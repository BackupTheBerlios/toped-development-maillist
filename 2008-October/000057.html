<PRE>Hi,

You right. It looks too slow to me. I've been loading some bigger 
designs and optimized version is almost swift - both @ linix and windows.
This is important question. Toped is focused on graphic speed. Can we do 
the following:

1. Let's transfer this discussion to the mailing list - you'll find 
links on the web site. It will be much easier for everybody.
2. I will appreciate to have more information about your platform.
3. It would be great if you can send the GDS to test it myself. It's 
quite possible that it is a bug in the drawing algo. You can use the 
alternative address on the web site

As I mention we're preparing a release right now, so bug reports like 
that are really welcome.

Regards
Svilen


&gt;<i> I am currently comparing layouteditor (www.layouteditor.net) and toped.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Graphics (zoom in/out, scroll ) is at least 10x slower than 
</I>&gt;<i> layouteditor on a big full chip layout (2mmx2mm) for a 0.35u process. 
</I>&gt;<i> A zoom all process takes 25 seconds in toped but in layouteditor, it 
</I>&gt;<i> takes almost 2.5 seconds.
</I>&gt;<i> Is this have anything to with OpenGL versus Qmatrix from QT? 
</I>
