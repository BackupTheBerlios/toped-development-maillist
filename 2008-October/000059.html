<PRE>Ercan,

Thanks for the feedback. It appears that you're in uncharted teritory. I 
never tried Toped on Vista (I don't have one) and as far as I'm aware 
Sergey is siting on XP as well.
Sergey?
What I know for sure is that the install package was compiled on XP. The 
good news from you is that it works on Vista. The drawing times of tens 
of seconds however are certainly not what we're working for.
There is no much point explaining to you that on other platforms Toped 
is much faster than that. It's much better if you see it yourself. 
Obviously we need somebody to spend some time on Vista and to 
investigate the problem. Could be anything even something as simple as 
recompilation on Vista.

OK, I'll make a bug out of your report. As I said though I don't have 
Vista unfortunately. Anybody willing to spend some time compiling Toped 
on Vista?

Regards
Svilen

P.S. Please hit &quot;reply to all&quot; button when you're mailing back to the 
mailing list. Otherwise only I'm getting the answer.
