Happy New Year!

Lulu,
I hope you don't mind that I'm forwarding your e-mail to the mailing list.
On your question directly - windows is not my primary environment, but I 
hope Sergey will have better idea what the problem can be.
Meanwhile - just to double-check - a couple of questions

I have myself very similar windows configuration, but with VC 2005 
Express edition. It looks like you're the first trying toped with VC 2008.
This could be the root of the problem. It could be that the packet has 
to be recompiled using the new compiler and more importantly - the new 
version of Microsoft libraries

Another question - do you have previous toped version installed ? - it 
might need to be removed manually

It's not a suggestion, just a question - have you tried the package 
before installing VC 2008? Have you tried it with the library proposed 
in the release notes  here ? 
<https://developer.berlios.de/project/shownotes.php?release_id=13554>


Sorry for the delay... on the mailing list you should get quicker answer 
now after the holidays

Regards
Svilen

Sorry Lulu,
I wasn't very careful, ignore the rubbish about VC 2008. I doesn't 
concern you...
 
My configuration is effectively the same as yours except that I have 
2005 express edition... I don't want to confuse you further :)

Sergey - help!

Regards
Svilen

Hello Lulu.

Microsoft successfully replaced "dll hell" to "manifest hell" :)
Before, I checked Toped on clean Russian and Chinese versions of Windows XP
SP2.
But today I found that  Toped can not start on English Windows XP with the
same error messages.
I going to investigate this problem as soon as possible.

Can you answer my questions:
1. What is your Windows version? English?
2. Did you install service pack for Visual Studio 2005?

Thanks a lot for your feedback.

Sergey

Hello all

I found solution! We used Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable Package
instead of Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 SP1 Redistributable Package.
Correct link is
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=200B2FD9-AE1A-4A14-984D-389C36F85647&displaylang=en
We have to update our download page.

Lulu, can you check it?


Sergey

P.S. BTW Now Toped can be run on Vista with  this SP1 Redistributable
Package.

 Hi all,

Thank you all for your attention !

Here i will have my special thanks to  Sergey Gaitukevich for his patients
adn replies .  :)

I will share my thoughts of this problem after successfully solved this
problem under help of Sergey Gaitukevich and Svilen Krustev.

I find the problem is totally due to *build version* of C++ Runtime library.
(sorry i can not tell exactly what type this version number is though i
think it is as i will explain later in this email). and the formal way of
solving this C++ Runtime Library problem is to install *Microsoft Visual C++
2005 SP1 Redistributable Package . *

The toped program which triggers error when opening is asking for Microsoft
CRT version  8.0. 50727.726. however, due to some problem of my Visual
Studio 2005,  there is no *.726 version of CRT installed in WinSxS directory
on my computer. (i do not know exactly why there is some files missing
though it still told me that installation is completed and success.
Unrelaible Microsoft!!)

So, the solution here is simply to check which version of Microsoft CRT your
toped program asks for and which version(s) you have in your Windows WinSxS
directory. Then, re-compiling toped using your existing CRT library OR
installing MS Visual C++ Redistributable Package to bring in newer version
of CRT library. I fixed it manully though i think is not encouraged to do
so.

Finally, it is a great lesson for me and hope it would help !

bset regards,


sincerely,

lulu
BTW,  Now the toped works well in my windows XP and i further tried toped
linux version during my new year vacation. Both are excellent !
