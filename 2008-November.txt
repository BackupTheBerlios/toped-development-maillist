Hi,

We are two weeks late from the anticipated release date, nevertheless 
the good news is that the release tag has been created:

http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/toped/tags/release_0.9.2/

The tag above should be used for generation of the installation packet 
(Windows) and source tarballs (Linux). All repository updates should be 
held until the release happens which is scheduled for tomorrow - 5/11/2008.

Sergey, I'm expecting the Windows packet - so I can upload it to Berlios.

Regards
Svilen

We're happy to announce that Toped 0.9.2 has been released and is now 
available for download at Berlios.
http://developer.berlios.de/projects/toped <https://developer.berlios.de/projects/toped/>

The release highlights:
    * CIF import/export
    * GDS data types are now taken into account during import and export operations
    * Further updates on the user interface customization.
    * Number of bug fixes

The initial release of a  SKILL - TELL conversion script will be announced shortly. It is designed to help in the translation of layout environment setup.

Call for packagers. I guess it is a good time to put some effort on Ubuntu Packaging.

Ubuntu Intrepid still has wxWidgets 2.8.8 but this toped release
requires 2.8.9. Is there something I am missing here? Or can I get it
down to 2.8.8 in the script?

Thanks and Regards,
Aanjhan

Aanjhan,

I guess it is safe to bring it down to 2.8.8. That's what we use on 
Windows at the moment. I've updated the configure script a couple of 
days ago, because fedora released officially 2.8.9. Otherwise the 
development was done on 2.8.8.

Please don't hesitate to ask questions. I'll be happy to help!

Regards
Svilen

Subject: [Toped-development] Roadmap to the next release
Message-ID: <491703C5.3010204@googlemail.com>

Hi,

It seems a proper time to share some thoughts and discuss some ideas 
about the next Toped release.

We do have some major development threads in the "official" TODO list, 
nevertheless it seems that it's a time to look around and make sure that 
the existing features are really finished, stable and usable. In other 
words it seems that we have to spend some time to consolidate and polish 
the existing features. Here is what I mean

Undocumented or unusable features.
- PostScript output. It exists for a couple of releases now. Not fully 
tested, not included in the menus, not documented, no examples etc.
- Screen snapshots. Some restrictions on the correct image generation, 
nevertheless it's there for some time now, but not included in the 
menus, not documented, no examples etc.
- User drawing optimisation - cell depth visibility, minimum object size 
visibility etc. - it's all there, but has to be wrapped with tell 
commands and user menus or dialogue boxes
- Controllable undo depth - same as above.

User interface. There is a lot of potential in the UI framework, but 
still some missing parts on it's way to "rise & shine".
- Customisable menu. It is there, but we didn't really advertise it, it 
is vaguely mentioned on the web site, no examples, no tll files with 
real configurations.
- Customisable toolbars. Some tell functions are missing there to 
achieve the planned functionality.
- Layer panel. Pretty much there, but still needs some attention and 
some polishing.
- Cell browser panel. Functionality is significantly improved in the 
last release, but still some odd behavior can be observed during "edit 
in place".
- Status line. Updated occasionally.
- tell lib panel. Missing documentation links of the build-in TELL 
functions.
- Dialogue boxes. Effectively all of them need polishing. We need to 
make sure that they look as expected on all platforms. Some of them (for 
example layer/fill/color definition) are very basic and require more 
substantial attention.

OpenGL drawing. The graphic hardware became powerful yet relatively 
cheap and accessible these days. We need to use the graphic hardware 
more intensively - this means to explore an alternative way of drawing 
keeping the existing one and giving the user a choice which one to use.

Multithreading. Although fairly stable, some locking can still be 
observed and depending on the platform it can be irritating.
- Main troubles are coming from the synchronisation of the cell browser 
panel with the database.
- Semaphores that we use need polishing and some additional features to 
give more control and visibility to the user.
- The openGL drawing which now is executed in the main thread should be 
launched in a separate thread.
- Still some situations (long GDSII conversions for example) which 
freeze the entire Toped window.Need investigation and updates.

Recovery. Needs more extensive and focused debugging to make sure that 
all individual TELL functions are executed properly in recovery mode.

TELL parser.
- Requires some relatively simple additions to give more visibility and 
control to the user. For example: Report/Clear variables or function 
definitions.
- Some additions to the lists and structures to make them more usable. 
Static typecasting to help the parser to recognise more complex 
anonymous structures.

In addition to all this it seems a good idea to add some libraries. They 
can be shipped/downloaded separately from the release. I mean
- Digital cell library directly in TDT format.
- library of TELL functions

All the above is telling to me that the next release should be a 
"consolidation" release. Nothing really new from development point of 
view. It looks like a long list and it is not full. Nevertheless most of 
the tasks require relatively little effort yet they will help to improve 
the overall stability and appearance of Toped.

Comments....
Updates....

Hello.
So many tasks :)
But I think we have to add new features.
At least those that already in development.

Most mentioned UI things are my job. I hope to finish it soon.

Beside it  we need more convenient hot keys for frequent operations
(cadence-like may be).

Another important thing is better error diagnostic for TELL.  We have it in
todo list and we need it ASAP.

 Regards,
   Sergey

Hello there,

I have the following rpmlint warnings on 0.9.2. Can anyone have a look
at these have them fixed for the next release, please?

chitlesh(devel)[0]$ rpmlint -i
/home/chitlesh/rpmbuild/RPMS/i386/toped-0.9.2-1.fc9.i386.rpm

toped.i386: W: shared-lib-calls-exit /usr/lib/libtpd_ifaces.so.0.0.0
exit at GLIBC_2.0

toped.i386: W: shared-lib-calls-exit /usr/lib/libtpd_common.so.0.0.0
exit at GLIBC_2.0

toped.i386: W: shared-lib-calls-exit /usr/lib/libtpd_parser.so.0.0.0
exit at GLIBC_2.0

This library package calls exit() or _exit(), probably in a non-fork()
context. Doing so from a library is strongly discouraged - when a library
function calls exit(), it prevents the calling program from handling the
error, reporting it to the user, closing files properly, and cleaning up any
state that the program has. It is preferred for the library to return an
actual error code and let the calling program decide how to handle the
situation

Kind regards,
Chitlesh

Hello there,

Below you will fine additional warnings that for the moment already
fixed in the Fedora toped 0.9.2 package. But it would be nice to have
those fixed upstream as well.

Kind regards,
Chitlesh

The binary contains unused direct shared library dependencies.  This may
indicate gratuitously bloated linkage; check that the binary has been linked
with the intended shared libraries only.

Chitlesh,

I'm trying to reproduce those warnings but without success for the 
moment. Obviously I'm missing something. Can you drop me link to the RPM?

Regards
Svilen

Hello there,

I have started deploying Fedora Electronic Lab (FEL) to EPEL
repositories. I am having to say that "toped" is the first package of
this deployment.

It is now a matter of time till it hits EPEL mirrors.

Chitlesh,

Thanks for the package. I saw your post about EPEL - I think it's a good 
idea and I'll be happy to help and conrtibute.
Well done!

Svilen

Hi Chitlesh,

I need your help here. I'm not an autotools expert and you can save me a 
lot of time flipping their howto's :)
I can see the problem and completely agree that this kind of "generous" 
linking should better be avoided. Can you tell me how did you fix the 
problem or maybe just point me to the .spec file that (I believe) 
contains the fix?

Regards
Svilen

Hello Svilen,

Actually,my 2 mentioned rpmlint warnings are:
- shared-lib-calls-exit (I have no fix for that, I was counting on you :) )
- unused-direct-shlib-dependency
In my spec file, I used:
%configure         \
  --with-gtk      \
  --with-opengl   \
  --disable-rpath \
  --enable-threads

# Remove rpath from libtool
sed -i 's|^hardcode_libdir_flag_spec=.*|hardcode_libdir_flag_spec=""|g' libtool
sed -i 's|^runpath_var=LD_RUN_PATH|runpath_var=DIE_RPATH_DIE|g' libtool

# clean unused-direct-shlib-dependencies
sed -i -e 's! -shared ! -Wl,--as-needed\0!g' libtool

for more details, for fixing before configure:
http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/qa/asneeded.xml


I have another request:
Since most distribution, I guess, have now already bundled
"electronics-menu", it would be nice to remove the categories:
- Education
- Science
from toped.desktop.
"electronics-menu" create an additional menu for "Electronics"
dedicated for engineering applications. Toped is not an education
application but engineering. Also gEDA & gaf and gerbv have been
actively supporting this new "electronic" menu structure.

Kind regards,
Chitlesh
