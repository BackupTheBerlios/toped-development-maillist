<PRE>Hi,
If we decide to have a new data types we will need converttopoly() or 
maybe even implicit conversion, hidden from the user. It must be done 
also for the wires, although it virtually exists already - that's the 
way we draw them.

1. Vertex accuracy will be determined by the user units of the database. 
(see the definition of the tdtdesign class  in tedesign.h DBU &amp; UU) The 
default and only possible at the moment is 1e-3. Good point - I have to 
update newdesign() function with an overloaded member with DBU and UU 
arguments.
You know of course that improving the accuracy will reduce the maximum 
possible size of the chip. At the end of the day it all comes down to 32 
bit integers which must be used in GDSII. Of course this won't remove 
the troubles with the DRC.

Concerning the off-grid points. As long as we have a dedicated type and 
store the arcs/circles using that type - everything should be on grid. 
When we convert that to a polygon, or create similar polygon from tell - 
everything will be off-grid potentially. Not sure we can do something 
about that anyway, because GDSII doesn't have similar types. Don't know 
about oasis - we have to check this!

2. If I understand the question properly - the short answer is no. The 
only way I see is conversion to a polygon and then applying the logic 
operations. Same for the logic operations with wires(which is not done 
yet) , although I'm quite tempted to try to preserve the type there  
when possible.
Anyway - polygons are the most common shape and logic operations are 
supposed to work for them.

On the second thought.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but you're thinking here about the high voltage 
devices and possibly bipolar? Then what about a box with rounded 
corners? And polygon and wire with rounded corners? Possibly with 
different radius for every corner... or that's too much? Circle and 
ellipse are then naturally produced from a box with rounded corners? HV 
gates can be drawn as a wire with rounded corners? Then we can think 
about preservation of the type after a logic operation.
What about this?

Regards
Svilen
