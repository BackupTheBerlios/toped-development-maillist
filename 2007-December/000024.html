<PRE>
Currently Toped and respectively TELL doesn't have a dedicated functions 
for circles, arcs and similar curves. This is an attempt to discuss the 
matter and to try to get better idea what shall be implemented and how.

WHAT: - It seems obvious that we need to implement some kind of curve 
primitive here - one or more. Circle alone doesn't seem to be that 
commonly used. Arc or segment of a circle are more often needed. Ideas?

HOW: - there are generally two possibilities:
- to keep toped clean from curves and to use tell functions producing 
appropriate polygons.
- to add one or more new data type in toped, and to update the tdt format.
First one will be easier and quicker to implement. It might result in a 
simpler view of the final rounded shapes and is likely will be more 
flexible.
The second one will produce more compact databases and most likely will 
be quicker to run.

In both cases we need a clear idea how to build the equivalent polygons. 
There use to be (I believe there still are) a lot of troubles with the 
back-end tools - DRC, fractioning etc.

It could be a good idea to combine both approaches. For more often used 
shapes - to introduce new toped data type(s). In the same time - we can 
add some math functions in tell which combined with lists will bring us 
all the flexibility we need. I mean sin/cos and it can be done really quick.

Regards
Svilen
