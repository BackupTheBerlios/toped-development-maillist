Subject: [Toped-development] toped on Fedora 9
Message-ID: <489B6024.5050405@tiscali.co.uk>


As you know it was impossible to run toped on Fedora 9 with the original 
video drivers. Vendor drivers are still not officially available.
That is the reason why we still don't have an RPM in FC9 repositories. 
It was clear from the beginning that the problem was that toped can't 
obtain a GLX visual with accumulation buffers. They are used for the 
interactive graphics. A long investigation but finally something popped-up.

Your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file has to be updated as shown below

Section "ServerLayout"
        ...
        Option         "GlxVisuals" "all"
EndSection

This is proved working on a platform with the ATI graphic card. I have 
no information about nVidia platforms and whether the problem there was 
existing on the first place.

The bad news is that the graphics still doesn't seem to be at its best, 
so this is not the end of the road.

Subject: [Toped-development] HELP! gdsii data_type example
Message-ID: <48B5A8C2.2070600@tiscali.co.uk>

Hi,

I started working on the  GDSII conversion update (data types). It 
appears though that I don't have a stream file which utilises DATA_TYPE 
property. All DATA_TYPE properties in the stream files that I have are 
assigned to 0.
This is not a terribly bad problem, but having a real example might help 
anyway.

It would be really appreciated if somebody can drop an example. It could 
be anything, not necessarily meaningful layout. The important point is 
to contain more than one data type per layer.

Thanks in advance!
Svilen

P.S. If you don't want to send the file publicly (or if the file is too 
big) please use the e-mail address on the web site.
