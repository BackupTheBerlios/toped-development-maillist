Subject: [Toped-development] RELEASE 0.85 branch
Message-ID: <45E76E55.7020605@tiscali.co.uk>

I've created a new branch in repository RELEASE_0.85_CAND
It is supposed to be used for critical bug fixes before and after the 
release.
All tarball/packet/install related updates are also welcome

The main question at the moment is how to setup an environment variable 
after the installation. In Linux and in Windows.
One of the variables ($TPD_GLOBAL) is used as a path to the font files. 
Without them Toped will be unstable.

Regards
Svilen

I'm not sure I understand the question. The rpm package comes with a 
toped.desktop file (thanks to Chitlesh) which contains also the name of 
the icon. You can see it in the ../ui directory of the project.
It's a good point actually... I have to make sure that it is installed 
properly from the tarball also.

I'm not sure about this... The commercial EDA tools are designed 
primarily for commercial UNIX platforms (Sun, HP etc.) and only recently 
for linux. Thiose platforms could (and do) have more differences. Our 
task is easier, because we're talking about linux only (at least for the 
time being)
If there is a common solution in the GNU world - we have to use it. 
There should be something...

It is up to you actually. Generally - if this is used to make a 
distribution - yes it should be in the repository. I presume it's not a 
binary file...

Cheers

I uploaded 0.8.5 release to Berlios. Both Linux and Windows. A tag 
release_0.8.5 is created in the repository.
Unofficial Fedora RPM package is included in the release as well. Over 
the weekend I'll add 64 bit RPM.

Call for packagers.
Fedora Extras repository (at least) has to be updated.

The web site will be updated early next week.

Hello there,

I'll be pushing this new version to fedora repositories this upcoming friday, 
leaving one week on testing on my part and some community members.

Meanwhile extensive testing will be done via mock to see whether there are any 
breakage or not.

FC6 has wxGTK-2.6 and F-devel has wxGTK-2.8.
Is this new code compatible with the wxGTK-2.8 or should I have to build it 
against a compat-wxGTK-2.6 for F-devel?

regards and good job Svilen
Chitlesh

Current release is supposed to be compatible with both 2.6 and 2.8 
versions of wxWidgets
