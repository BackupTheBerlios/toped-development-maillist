Subject: [Toped-development] toped failing to build
Message-ID: <2f712e030906062255ka95cf1fxfbc3a4067e29fe4c@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to compile toped under FreeBSD, but the configure script is
failing to configure my system. I'm running configure with
--with-wx-config=wxgtk2-2.8-config \
                       --with-gtk \
                       --with-opengl \
                       --with-regex \
                       --enable-threads --enable-unicode \
                       --with-g77 F77=/usr/local/bin/gfortran43

but when I run make I get:

Hi,
Not a FreeBSD user, but...
Obviously some of the autotools subscripts I'm using need attention or 
replacement. It looks like the configure expects the headers to be in 
/usr/include/...

You can help the script adding an include directory at the command line 
- something like this:
 > configure <...options...> CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include
If you have troubles with include directories, you might have similar 
troubles with library directories. If that's the case you could need to 
point-out the location of the libraries for the linker (LDFLAGS). Should 
be pretty similar - try "configure --help" for more details.

It seems also that some of the options are redundant: g77 and also 
--with-* stuff. The latter is probably more appropriate for wx 
compilation. As I said though - I'm not using FreeBSD , so whatever 
works for you.

Let me know how is it going...

Regards
Svilen

Hello!

Thankyou very much by your attention.
I did your sugestion with

[ota at squitch ~/workspace/toped/work/toped-0.9.2]$ ./configure
--with-wx-config=wxgtk2-2.8-config --with-gtk --with-opengl
--with-regex --enable-threads --enable-unicode
CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include/GL

But when I run gmake I get
.

Making all in tpd_common

Looks like if the configure script don't use CPPFLAGS. :(
This scripts is working fine under Linux?

Thanks

Well you'll have to remove the "GL" part (see what I suggested 
previously) because it's already in the include statements in the code. 
So you command line would be:

[ota at squitch ~/workspace/toped/work/toped-0.9.2]$ ./configure
--with-wx-config=wxgtk2-2.8-config --with-gtk --with-opengl
--with-regex --enable-threads --enable-unicode
CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include

By the way you can see that the script is using this argument - the 
extra include directory appears in your log.
I would suggest also to try a shorter command:

[ota at squitch ~/workspace/toped/work/toped-0.9.2]$ ./configure
--with-wx-config=wxgtk2-2.8-config CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include

I believe the rest is redundant

Try and let me know

Regards
Svilen

P.S. Sorry I didn't catch-up you name

I try the last option

> [ota at squitch ~/workspace/toped/work/toped-0.9.2]$ ./configure
> --with-wx-config=wxgtk2-2.8-config CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include

And then, the build works! :)
I was think that the GL is need in the /usr/local/include :O

I got a lot of warnings like this
../ui/toped16x16.xpm:140: warning: deprecated conversion from string
constant to 'char*'
but the build ends without errors.

Thank you very much by your help.

Subject: [Toped-development] [Bug #15894] GDS DBU units are parsed improperly
Message-ID: <200906211239.n5LCdQH6006386@unicorn.berlios.de>

Bug #15894, was updated on 2009-Jun-21 13:39
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: toped
Category: other
Status: Open
Resolution: None
Bug Group: bug
Priority: 9
Submitted by: s_krustev
Assigned to : s_krustev
Summary: GDS DBU units are parsed improperly

Details: DBU is a central parameter in the GDS conversion and it is not quite clear why it was not spotted earlier.
The problem is not in the conversion of the reals (gds <--> ieee), but rather (stupidly) in the fact the curnum input parameter to GDSin::GdsRecord::retData(...) function was ignored when data type was gdsDT_REAL8B.

It's still quite astonishing how the conversion was working ?!?

Subject: [Toped-development] [Bug #15937] part select/unselect behave
	differently
Message-ID: <200906282139.n5SLdQge006163@unicorn.berlios.de>

Bug #15937, was updated on 2009-Jun-28 22:39
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: toped
Category: other
Status: Open
Resolution: None
Bug Group: bug
Priority: 1
Submitted by: s_krustev
Assigned to : s_krustev
Summary: part select/unselect behave differently

Details: This happens with cell references. A reference (cell) can't be part selected, so it will be picked-up by part select command only if it is overlapped entirely by the selection box.
That's not quite the case with part unselect. A reference is unselected even if only one of the edges is under the selection box
