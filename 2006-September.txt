Subject: [Toped-development] Bugfix release 0.81
Message-ID: <45071C7C.1000709@tiscali.co.uk>

Hi,
I'm planning to freeze the source code of /branches/RELEASE_0.8_BUGFIX 
and to make a release 0.81 at the end of this week. What remains there 
is to update the NEWS and README files and the version number of the build.
Please let me know if you're planning more bug fixes or if something 
critical poped-up recently

Svilen
