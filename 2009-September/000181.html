<PRE>Hi,
It has been some time since our 0.94 release. It looks to me that it's a 
time to make a bugfix release. Number of fixes are already submitted in 
the trunk. They are related to:

- Linux packaging
- Stability with various graphic drivers
- Multithread related locks
- GDS conversion

The latter is probably the main reason to produce the release. I spent 
last four weeks chasing the troubles with the conversion of multi 
gigabyte stream files. The conversion bottleneck was found and resolved. 
It's a relief to say that the problem was not principal - it was rather 
stupid. Toped converts such kind of files within minutes now.

Profiling the code with such amount of data prove to be quite a fun, but 
this is a different subject.

I'll appreciate your opinion about a quick release, so we can summarise 
the remaining tasks and nail down the schedule.

Regards
Svilen
