<PRE>Hi,
One thing I missed in my initial post was the size and step of the array 
references. It seems that one function here replacing all four 
parameters at once should be enough.
&gt;<i> &gt;--&gt; Changing the object layer of selected objects:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    changelayer(&lt;target_layer&gt;)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    The question is whether we need a source layer in this function or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;not. If we don't have a source layer parameter, then it's possible to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;select objects from different layers and to move them to the target
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;layer. This seems to be more flexible but more dangerous functionality.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We can warn user when he use this function for multiple layers.
</I>OK
There will be undo available, so a warning in the log window should be 
enough. No source_layer parameter.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> More useful function what we need (at least i need):
</I>&gt;<i>     resizelayer(&lt;target_layer&gt;, step)   
</I>This is a logic operation.  I know they are missing, but it is a subject 
of another discussion. Actually there is nothing to discuss - we need 
this. The only trouble is that it will require more time.
&gt;<i> &gt;--&gt; Layer transfer:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    trasferlayer(&lt;source_layer&gt;, &lt;target_layer&gt;, &lt;hierarchical&gt;)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    This is supposed to work over the entire layer, not on the selected
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;objects. That's why source_layer parameter is required. The hierarchical
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;option will make possible to change the layers in the entire design or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;just on a branch of the hierarchy. If there were objects selected in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;source_layer they should remain selected in the target one.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    copylayer(&lt;source_layer&gt;, &lt;target_layer&gt;, &lt;hierarchical&gt;)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    Not sure we need this...at last not for editor purposes
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think this functionality must be placed into import/export gds.
</I>&gt;<i> Too dangerous for regular operation.
</I>I though that it's a good idea, and meanwhile I start implementing it. 
The forward operation is not a problem. The problem comes with undo. It 
breaks literally the basics of the undo operation, because it should 
work on a hierarchy of cells i.e. the undo related data should contain 
information about the cell, while all other undo operations work 
strictly on the current cell. To cut the long story short - undo is not 
feasible if the operation is hierarchical. Then the whole function is 
redundant, because it is not any different from changelayer(&lt;target_layer&gt;)
Putting it in the gds import/export is a known idea - we already have 
two pass gds conversion. Nevertheless the initial idea was that the 
function can be used as a regular operation and if undo was available - 
then it wasn't that dangerous.
So the way forward seem to be TELL with something similar to what you 
are proposing below about texts.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;--&gt; Text manipulation - all functions work on the selected text objects.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    changetextsize(&lt;new_size&gt;)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    The idea here seems to be trivial. More interesting will be if we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;have to increase/decrease the text size by X...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    changetext(&lt;new_text&gt;, &lt;old_text&gt;)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;.........
</I>&gt;<i> Too many cases we must take account(replace sizes, fonts and so on).
</I>&gt;<i> I think much better provide syntax sugar for such operation in TELL. 
</I>&gt;<i> Like this
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> all_texts = selectobject(text, regexp(&quot;path*&quot;));
</I>&gt;<i> for_each(all_texts, lambda(x)
</I>&gt;<i> {
</I>&gt;<i>     string str = getproperty(x, text);
</I>&gt;<i>     string str1 = replacesubstring(str, &quot;path&quot;, &quot;bus&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i>     replaceproperty(x, text, str1))
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>I already kind of agreed with this. Of course the syntax above is just 
an example I guess. It requires two , actually 3 major updates in TELL 
and one in toped.
- work with lists - we have lists at the moment, but we can't use them 
really, except for some build-in toped functions. Lists are waiting for 
some basic functionality like adding/removing first/last etc.
- another type of loop - foreach. This I would agree is the syntactic 
sugar for traversing the lists, because it can be done using more 
&quot;traditional&quot; loop operators.
- recursion. Simple thing that we don't have in TELL. Like all simple 
things it might be a source of troubles. We going to need it in order to 
implement layer transfer across the hierarchy, cell reference changes 
and similar things. Maybe I forgot to mention that it's relatively 
simple to introduce a function that will return all the child cells of 
the current cell, then using recursive calls it will be possible to do 
stuff across the hierarchy. And having undo as well.
- in toped we'll need to introduce select filters - not only shape 
types(text,ref,wire etc) , but also property values
&gt;<i> The same for
</I>&gt;<i>     changereference(&lt;old_cell
</I>&gt;<i> _name&gt;,&lt;new_cell_name&gt;,&lt;hierarchical&gt;)
</I>&gt;<i> It's useful function, but
</I>&gt;<i>     changereference(&lt;new_cell_name&gt;)
</I>&gt;<i> only on script level.
</I>We'll have to drop the &lt;hierarchical&gt; parameter here. Reasons are the 
same as for transferlayer. Then it appears that only one function - the 
second one will be enough. And undo will be there. Hierarchical 
operations will be possible via TELL as discussed above - and that's a 
script level.
Well any user function can be added to the toped menu by the user, so 
I'm not sure what do you mean to keep it on script level.

Svilen
