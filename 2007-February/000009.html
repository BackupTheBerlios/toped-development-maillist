<PRE>Hi,
At the moment there are at least two areas of edit operations where 
Toped lacks functionality.

Property changes in layout objects.
    - Contents and size of the text objects (not mentioning fonts yet)
    - Referenced cells in cellref and cellaref objects
    - Layer change - for all objects

Layer and cross-layer transfers
    - move/copy a layer (as a whole) to another layer
    - move/copy selected objects to another layer

Here is the initial idea for the new TELL functions, that should fill-up 
this gap.

--&gt; Changing the object layer of selected objects:
    changelayer(&lt;target_layer&gt;)
    The question is whether we need a source layer in this function or 
not. If we don't have a source layer parameter, then it's possible to 
select objects from different layers and to move them to the target 
layer. This seems to be more flexible but more dangerous functionality.

--&gt; Layer transfer:
    trasferlayer(&lt;source_layer&gt;, &lt;target_layer&gt;, &lt;hierarchical&gt;)
    This is supposed to work over the entire layer, not on the selected 
objects. That's why source_layer parameter is required. The hierarchical 
option will make possible to change the layers in the entire design or 
just on a branch of the hierarchy. If there were objects selected in the 
source_layer they should remain selected in the target one.
    copylayer(&lt;source_layer&gt;, &lt;target_layer&gt;, &lt;hierarchical&gt;)
    Not sure we need this...at last not for editor purposes

--&gt; Text manipulation - all functions work on the selected text objects.
    changetextsize(&lt;new_size&gt;)
    The idea here seems to be trivial. More interesting will be if we 
have to increase/decrease the text size by X...
    changetext(&lt;new_text&gt;, &lt;old_text&gt;)
    It's interesting here. Not very often you'll need to change the 
contents of a bunch of text object to a new common one. In the same time 
- quite often the one will have to change part of the string. For 
example changing the bus name, or more general - replacing a substring 
on a list of strings. The idea is that parameters here can contain 
global characters or even better - to keep the door open for some 
limited regular expression syntax embedded in both parameters. Although 
the implementation seems to be quite a lot of work, that's what will be 
useful. In the same time we still can have:
    changetext(&lt;new_text&gt;)
    Which can be the trivial version

--&gt; Reference cell manipulation
    changereference(&lt;old_cell_name&gt;,&lt;new_cell_name&gt;,&lt;hierarchical&gt;)
    This function should work with entire database - not the selected 
objects only. The functionality should be similar to the trasferlayer, 
but targeting cells. This should allow to change a reference over the 
entire design.
    changereference(&lt;new_cell_name&gt;)
    Should work on selected references only. Again the question is - do 
we need an old_cell_name parameter here. Without it, the function is 
more powerful, but I can't think of a case when the user will want to 
modify reference objects pointing to different cells, and to make them 
referencing another common cell. And to do it in one shot. Means it 
might be a source of troubles.

On top of the above it seems that some parametrization of the select 
functions have to be added as well.
There is no way to select text objects only. Neither wires only. Same is 
for cells, although it should be quite easy to implement the latter. 
Some selection parameters might be useful also, like cell names or text 
strings. They can be a good addition to the functions described above.

Ideas, comments?

Regards
Svilen
