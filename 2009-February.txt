Subject: [Toped-development] Difficulties visualising Toped graphics
Message-ID: <341981.44077.qm@web202.biz.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

I have compiled Toped 0.9.2 on Ubuntu Hardy Heron. I don't see
any layout graphics and the font on the second toolbar is wrong.
I've attached a screen snapshot toped_screen.gif.

If I draw say a wire, then moving the cursor around allows me to
see intermittently the black background. I've managed to capture
this in toped_screen2.gif.

Any ideas on what is going on?

The toped_screen2.gif graphic shows an unusual text arrangement.
Something is wrong, but I don't know what as I can't see any
layout. The exported GDS from this cell is fine.

best regards, Graham Petley

I want to read my standard cell library into Toped, write out
a GDS file and create a Toped database.

I have attached my TELL script. Some comments at the bottom
describe the problems. I think some of these come from Toped
not always completing the read of the TELL script, so that
one has to repeatedly try opening Toped and reading the script
until all the cells are read.

Other problems are
- tdtsave and gdsexport not accepted from within the script
- tdtsave only accepted from menu File>Save
- tdtsave not accepted after a gdsexport
- gdsexport not accepted after a tdtsave
- tdtsave causes Toped to use all CPU cycles of both processors

I think these are all inter-related and it isn't clear what is the
cause and effect here.

The CIF files referenced in the TELL script are in the standard cell
download at www.vlsitechnology.org.

At the end, after repeated attempts, I am able to make the Toped
database and export the GDS file. It would be nice to do it in
one simple script.

Hi Graham,

I'll have a look at your script and will get back to you ASAP. Porting 
of your libraries into TDT was staying in my TODO list, but right now we 
both with Sergey are kind of busy at work, besides I've sinked into 
developing a new rederer. I really do appreciate your effort and will do 
my best to help.

Regards
Svilen

Hi Graham,

I'll have some questions on this one first. Unfortunately I don't have 
Ubuntu installed and we don't have a distribution for it, but it's 
probably a good time to start doing something about it.
I've started a download over night, so hopefully I'll have a CD tomorow. 
So here are the questions
- graphic card (ATi, nVidia),  driver, X versions etc. ? You can get 
this from "glxinfo" and "xdpyinfo".

Your toped window certainly doesn't look great :) We need to resolve 
this in order to discuss the other effects. During an interactive 
drawing the screen is redrawn at each mouse move - that's probably the 
reason how you can "see" something, but normally the background should 
be black. If it isn't - toped can't even clear the canvas which 
indicates that there is something wrong with the connection to the 
underlying graphic libraries.

- About the texts if you imported a layout - if I remember well from 
CIF,  texts are comming unusually big. Try to zoom in (mouse scroll 
wheel is the easiest way) and see whether you can see something more 
sensible. I seem to remember having similar effect with your libraries - 
CIF format doesn't have a text size parameter and the default is 
probably unadequate.

Regards
Svilen

Hi Graham,

I found the problem, thanks for your feedback. See further comments in 
the text below.

I will generate a patch for version 0.9.2 which should remove the 
troubles you're describing in this e-mail.  I'll try to do it tomorrow.

Fixing the troubles with the graphics on Ubuntu might take longer - 
simply because none of us has it installed.

Regards
Svilen

I can see the problem here. Toped is a multi thread application. There 
is a thread related bug specific to the CIF conversion which I just 
found thanks to your script example. I fixed it locally and the 
application doesn't lock itself any more. The script is executed until 
the end every time. 
Just as a confirmation - in the bottom right corner Toped has an 
indication of a running(active) thread. If it's red - means that 
something is going on or (as in this case) the threads are mutually locked.

There is no facilities in 0.9.2 to unlock the application - so it is 
virtually dead. Also in that revision Toped will queue the commands even 
if a thread is locked (the main thread is still alive) and it's not easy 
for the user to find out what's going on. This has been addressed and 
some changes are already in place, so the log window will indicate that 
a command can't be executed because there is another process which is 
using the database at the moment.
This of course is not helping in your situation - all I'm trying to say 
is that some of the commands listed below doesn't work because the 
applications was (most likely) already locked and dead because of the bug.

See my comment above about locking. All menu commands do generate tell 
commands. There is no different execution patterns - whether you type a 
command or click it with the mouse from the menu. The difference with 
the script is only coming form the fact that when a script is executed 
the commands are coming with the speed which is impossible to be 
achieved interactively (that's the whole idea isn't it? :) )  and some 
troubles can be highlighted very quickly.

About tdtsave - you are right - tdtsave() won't work as it is on your 
script. This is an unnecessary extra check (for active cell) in the save 
operations that should be removed. This can be easily avoided if you 
open any of the cells that you've already converted. for example:

opencell("xor3v1x2");

will then allow subsequent
tdtsave();
gdsexport(pharosc_gdsmap,"pharosc200.gds",false);

I agree - they are related and I think I found the problem - as 
explained above

I agree. That's the whole idea.

Hi Svilen,
   I've pasted the glxinfo and xdpyinfo below. My machine is
a MacBook Pro with two processors, the 32 bit ones running at
2.17MHz. I'm dual booting Ubuntu and MAC OS X Tiger.
   The odd thing about the text read in with CIF is that a
GDS file written out appears to have correct text. I use
Klayout to visualise the GDS.
best regards, Graham Petley

Hi Graham,
Thanks for the info. When I realise that you're running on MacBook I was
almost sure that the problems should be mac specific, but decided to see
first how Toped will perform on my Ubuntu.

It took me some time today to put together an Ubuntu development
environment, but I have it now. It was a surprise for me to see troubles
with the graphics - very similar to what you see. The canvas is empty
and intermittently if I zoom in/out I can see something. I've just
started to dig - at the moment don't know yet what's the problem.

One more question for you. Can you please post (when convenient for you)
the contents of your log window when you execute tcase.tll just after
launching Toped. The file is in the package and should be in tll
directory.

I'll get back to the CIF texts later.

Regards
Svilen

Hi Svilen,
   Here it is.

<= Please report a bugs to toped-development at lists.berlios.de or bugs at toped.org.uk
=> #include "/home/cad/src/toped-0.9.2/tll/tcase.tll";
<= Parsing "/home/cad/src/toped-0.9.2/tll/tcase.tll" ...
<= Parsing "/home/cad/share/toped/tll/seed.tll" ...
<= line 252: col 0: Can't redeclare internal function "addbox"

I'm glad you can reproduce the error. I'm looking for a fix
soon!
   I had been unable to compile version 0.8.6. I don't know if this
has some connection.

   The Toped start screen is also too tall. I have to lower the top
to the bottom of the toolbar with the icons. I don't know if you
see the same problem.

best regards, Graham Petley

Hello,

I like Graham involvement for more compatibility with his standard
cells. I would appreciate if toped developers could help to make it
possible.

I'll be eager to do the required testing for you.

Kind regards,
Chitlesh

Hi Graham,

Thanks for the feedback. I did some updates that seem to fix some of the 
troubles on Ubuntu. If they work for you - I hope it will keep you going 
for some time. I didn't prepare a separate patch, because my intention 
is to keep going with the updates (at least the toolbar), nevertheless 
you can try them already.

The patched version of 0.9.2 release can be checked out using the 
command below

svn co http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/toped/branches/RELEASE_0.92_CAND toped

 From this point on it's pretty much the same as compiling the tarball - 
you can see some short instructions on the web here

http://www.toped.org.uk/faq.html#id320400

If you don't have svn already installed - you need subversion package.

Please let me know whether you can see any difference. I wanted also to 
warn you about the files you've succeeded to produce (GDS & TDT) from 
the CIF sources. With the mutex bug in it's highly likely that they 
won't contain all the source cells. In other words - if the fixes work 
as expected please regenerate the output files.

I didn't do any changes about the text sizes - I would like to discuss 
this with you in a bit more details.

Regards
Svilen

P.S. If you're curious - you can find a bit more details about the bugs

Subject: [Toped-development] Difficulties visualising Toped graphics
In-Reply-To: <498F74B2.4080907@googlemail.com>
Message-ID: <809551.40334.qm@web208.biz.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

Hi Svilen,
I've just noticed that the gds file exported from the cif2tdt
TELL script has its geometries scaled 500X too small. A cell
which should be 32um wide is actually 0.064um.
The gds2tdt script exports correctly sized gds files.
I think this is where the text size discrepancy comes from.

best regards, Graham Petley

Subject: [Toped-development] Difficulties visualising Toped graphics
In-Reply-To: <498F74B2.4080907@googlemail.com>
Message-ID: <417993.99967.qm@web202.biz.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

Hi Svilen,

I recompiled toped from the cvs. It's the first time I've
done this, and the process wasn't exactly like the doc, so
I'll describe it here to make sure I did it properly.

1/ Checking my original compile from source, I see that
   in order to get it to work I had to hack the ./configure
   file. It was checking for version 2.8.9 of wxWidgets,
   and I have 2.8.7. The web site says this version of
   wxWidgets is OK. Is this right?

2/ I don't have gmake on my system. Googling showed that
   make is the same.

3/ The svn command created a directory toped. Running
   make failed:

   $ make -f Makefile.cvs
   srcdir=`pwd` sh macros/autogen.sh
   macros/autogen.sh: 2: aclocal: not found
   macros/autogen.sh: 3: libtoolize: not found
   macros/autogen.sh: 4: automake: not found
   macros/autogen.sh: 5: autoconf: not found
   make: *** [all] Error 127

   I didn't have any of aclocal, libtoolize, automake or
   autoconf. Installing automake and autoconf also gave me
   aclocal. To get libtoolize I had to install libtool.

4/ The compile sequence to install toped to /home/cad/bin
   is then

   $ make -f Makefile.cvs
   $ ./configure2 --prefix=/home/cad
   $ make
   $ make install

   ./configure2 is my hacked version of configure which
   checks for wxWidgets 2.8.7 instead of 2.8.9.

I don't get any graphics, but the cif read TELL script
now works OK. Thanks. I have a similar gds read script
which doesn't work properly, which I have attached.

best regards, Graham Petley

Hi Graham,

All that you did looks fine to me. It's a bit of a disappointment about 
the graphics. See more comments in the text below.

That's right. I realise that you did this before for the tarball, that's 
why I didn't mentioned it.

Yes, it is the same.

Sorry for the troubles.  I also had to install the tools one by one - 
couldn't find an option to install the "standard" development pack at 
once on Ubuntu.

That should be right.

Sorry about the graphics. As I thought it will take longer 
unfortunately. I have for the moment all info I need from you. It works 
for me now, but I have some ideas which I have to double check.
The problem with the GDS is completely the same. I have it fixed 
locally, but want to do some more work before asking you to try again :)

Hi Graham,

Sorry - I allowed myself to change the subject.

About CIF coordinates - you're right. I can see the difference after 
importing GDS and CIF. I've missed the coefficient when transferring CIF 
coordinates to TDT. My problem however is that I can't get to a factor 
of 500.
Currently the TDT DB is using the GDSII convention:
DBU - Size of database units in meters (1e-9 by default)
UU - Size of user unit in DBU (1e-3 by default)
Then all coordinates are represented internally in database units as 
32-bit integers. UU is used in the user interfaces for convenience. 
Import/Export to GDSII is trivial in this matter, because it is 
virtually the same.

CIF is using also integers to represent the coordinates and they are 
talking about the precision 1/100 microns (i.e. 1e-8) which is a 
constant. If I understand this properly my coefficient on CIF import 
should be 10. Where the other 50 are coming from?

Regards
Svilen

P.S. Because CIF definition is quite fuzzy and there are a lot of 
interpretations - I did a wiki page. You can find a reference to the 
paper I was using there

Hi Svilen,
   I checked my CIF files for the correct usage of the scaling
factor on the Definition Start (DS) line.

   With a 2um techno I have

DS 1 100 2;
L CCC;
B 4 4 10 126;

The scaling is 100/2=50 which transforms the Box (B) to

B 200 200 500 6300;

These co-ordinates are in centimicrons, so in microns we
have a box 2x2um centred at (x,y)=(5,63).

   With a 0.13um techno I have

DS 1 1 4;
L CCC;
B 64 64 110 1386;

The scaling is 1/4 which transforms the Box (B) to

B 16 16 27.5 346.5;

These co-ordinates are in centimicrons, so in microns we
have a box 0.16x0.16um centred at (x,y)=(0.275,3.465).

In the case of the 2um techno, I think the CIF writer has used the
scaling factor as a way to reduce the CIF file size. All
co-ordinates are on an integer multiple and one could use

DS 1 1 1;
B 200 200 500 6300;

In the case of the 0.13um techno, the resolution is 5nm which is
less than 1 centimetre. So a scaling factor must be used to force
all geometry turnpoints in the CIF file to an integer multiple.

In both cases, the CIF writer (these examples come from Magic)
has chosen the scaling factor which gives the smallest set of
integer numbers (should be min file size) compatible with the
turnpoints all being an even multiple.

I think this is because the centre point of a box can be off
grid.

For the 2um techno, the 2x2 contact above goes from
(4,62) to (6,64). If we have a 3x3 contact extending from
(4,62) to (7,65), then this is a box

DS 1 100 2;
L CCC;
B 6 6 11 127;

with centre point at (5.5,63.5). So even if the turnpoints in this
techno are all on a 1um multiple, the centre point of boxes will
be on a 0.5um multiple. This has to remain an integer in the
CIF file.

Same with the 0.13um techno and a 0.165x0.165um contact
extending from (0.195,3.385) to (0.36,3.55). This is a box

DS 1 1 4;
L CCC;
B 66 66 111 1387;

with centre point at (0.2775,3.4675). Again the turnpoints are
on a 5nm (0.005um) multiple, but the box centre points are on
a 2.5nm one.

The CIF writer has to analyse the geometry turnpoints to find
the correct choice of scaling factor.

hope this helps, Graham Petley

	the DB coefficients
Message-ID: <200902102356.n1ANuVg4022768@unicorn.berlios.de>

Bug #15241, was updated on 2009-Feb-10 23:56
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: toped
Category: other
Status: Open
Resolution: None
Bug Group: bug
Priority: 5
Submitted by: s_krustev
Assigned to : s_krustev
Summary: CIF import doesn't take in mind the DB coefficients

Details: Each CIF coordinate on import has to be multiplied by a coefficient (1e-8/DBU)*(a/b) where:
- a and b a coefficients defined by DS command, 
- DBU is the database unit coefficient of the current TDT
- 1e-8 is the CIF integer precision which is constant.

Hi Graham,
The GDS fix is now in the repository. If you update - i.e from your 
toped source directory execute

svn update
make
make install

it should be enough to check your gds2tdt script.

I have no news about the the graphics yet. Still playing with different 
graphics setups to try to get the failure back.

Svilen

Hi Graham,

You're absolutely right. Last night when I switched off my computer I 
realise that I forgot about the parameters of DS command. I'm parsing 
them, but then they remain unused. That's where my factor is hidden.
I've raised two bugs about this. I'll keep you updated about the 
progress on them.

Thanks for your help!

Regards
Svilen

Hi Graham,

After a couple of days and several Ubuntu installations I still don't 
have a solution for your troubles.
If I compile the original 0.92 tarball - I have problems with the 
graphics as I already mentioned, but the latest patches in 
../branches/RELEASE_0.92_CANDIDATE repository are fixing it. From the 
info reports I can see that you're having ATI card and you're using ATI 
drivers.
I'll try to write a short test to try to diagnose the troubles - I'll 
let you know when I have it.

Working also on fixing the CIF interfaces...

Regards
Svilen

Hi Graham,
I've submitted the fixes for CIF import and will very much appreciate if
you help me to validate them.

There is one remaining question though and this not surprisingly is the
text size. There is no text size in CIF (as far as I'm aware). What I've
done for the moment - all texts will have the size of the cell
coefficient they are instantiated in.

Looking at your examples below - for 2um techno - all the texts will
have a size of 0.5 um - (100 / 2) * 1e-8. 
For 0.13um techno they will have a size of 2.5nm (1 / 4) * 1e-8.

This is temporary. I'll appreciate your opinion. If the solution can't
be found in the CIF - I'm planning to introduce a new parameter in the
TELL functions with will give the size of all text related objects.

Regards
Svilen

P.S. In order to get the updates - you need to execute
svn update
from the directory you're checked out .../branches/RELEASE_0.92_CAND and
then execute 
make
sudo make install
Please don't hesitate to ask questions. If it is easier for you - I can
submit a tarball.

Subject: [Toped-development] X11R7.4 packages - FC10
Message-ID: <499897D6.2080702@tiscali.co.uk>

Hi Chitlesh,

I just did a fresh FC10 installation to try to reproduce troubles of 
Sandesh with Toped graphics. This week I lost the count of the new Lunux 
installs I did (Fedora and Ubuntu) Here is what I see.
On fresh installation (without any updates) with the original Mesa 
driver Toped won't run - exactly as Sandesh reported it. The problem - 
as far as I can see it - is pretty much the same as the one described on 
wiki for FC9. GLX is version 1.2 and the number of GLX visuals is 
restricted. See below what glxinfo reports in short.

Actually because the GLX version is prior to 1.3, wxWidgets can not use 
frame buffers (GLXFBConfigs), but only GLX Visuals. The number of GLX 
visuals is restricted and none of them offers an accumulation buffer. 
Thus Toped can't run. The problem is that GLXFB buffers can't be used 
whatsoever with GLX version 1.2. All this in detail is described on the wiki

http://toped.wikispaces.com/Toped+on+Fedora+9

There is a good chance that "yum update" will fix the problem updating 
the Mesa driver and the new one will support GLX version 1.4, but this 
depends on the state of the driver for the particular graphic card 
installed on your system. I didn't do that yet, because I want to see 
how to fix the problem in the original FC10.

It is getting more interesting. Our proposed fix for FC9 was a line in 
the /etc/X11/xorg.conf. The problem is that this file is not shipped any 
more with X11R7.4. The X figures "automagically" your graphics setup. My 
problem is that there is nowere to put the fix?! There should be a way 
to create xorg.conf and add that line there, but it's getting really 
hairy for the ordinary user. With a vendor driver the problem doesn't 
exist because on the fist place they all maintain GLX 1.4, then they 
don't have a restricted number of GLX visuals by default and finally 
they create xorg.conf

On Ubuntu 8.10 should be the same, because they ship with X11R7.4

That's all for the moment. I'll appreciate any help

Svilen

Hello Svilen,

I would say forget F10 now and focus on F11. Fran?ois Cami, the fedora
developer, has put toped into his Mesa/Xorg sanity checks. I would
file a bug report so that this issue could be tracked.

regards,
Chitlesh

Hi Svilen,
   For the text size, I think this doesn't need to be in
the CIF file. If text is rendered on the screen at about
2.5mm tall, this should be OK.
best regards, Graham Petley
PS. All emails from the Toped development list have as
their sender toped-development at lists.berlios.de, whoever
they are from. Is there any way to have the real sender
listed in the from field?

After opening Toped I selected in turn the options under
the Layers tab and got the following errors.
Nothing is defined, so I guess that's why it's choking.
But it's not very elegant. A cleaner message, or nothing
at all, would be preferable.

Actually what I want to do is concatenate two strings

Hi Graham,

A quick answer is - there are no string operations in TELL yet.

I can see what's your idea and agree it's worth having this. On top of this
- some OS related functions like 'ls' will come also handy I guess. I'll
rase a feature request.

The " echo (lib cell);" is a bug of course.

More in the evening...

Regards
Svilen

Hi Graham

You are right. I fixed it.
Now there is no message if we have  empty layer list.
You can download new source code from
../branches/RELEASE_0.92_CAND repository.

Hi Svilen,
   The CIF and GDS import from the script is now working
fine.
   There is another issue which I'm debugging and will
notify with a different email subject.

Subject: [Toped-development] Reading CIF file crashes Toped
Message-ID: <305217.86623.qm@web205.biz.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

When I import the attached cif file aoi21v0x05.cif (0.13um
techno), I get an error 

toped: datacenter.cpp:441: void CIFin::Cif2Ted::box(CIFin::CifBox*, laydata::tdtlayer*, std::string): Assertion `check.valid()' failed.
                   Aborted

I tracked this down to the geometry on line 85.

B 88 6 88 1119;

This is a rectangle with height of only 0.015um. I have attached
a graphic toped1.gif which shows this rectangle of layer CM1.

I think the CIF file is OK. The gdsimport of the cell works OK.
I've attached aoi21v0x05.gds which I think is the same as the
CIF file on the CM1 layer.

best regards, Graham Petley

Subject: [Toped-development] CIF texts and sizes
In-Reply-To: <239486.18986.qm@web202.biz.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

Hi Graham,

Texts in CIF and in GDS are quite different objects. CIF doesn't care 
about their size, GDS - does. We follow GDS model in this and texts in 
Toped should have a size - exactly as in GDS. It is not feasible to have 
a texts with "floating" size. This would be a new object in the data 
base which will raise a number of questions at least about different 
conversions.
The simplest solution in this case seem to be an additional input 
parameter to cifimport() function which can be possibly defined as a 
techno or just text size. Having that - all texts will be defined with 
that size and will appear also with that size in the GDS.

I'll raise a feature request about this. Yet I'm ready to hear further 
ideas...

Concerning e-mails - that's the way I've set-up the mailing list 
recently. The problem is that it is a public mailing list and it could 
be (and it is) mirrored on different sites - for example here
https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/toped-development/2009-February/thread.html
Having an open e-mail addresses there is a heaven for the spammers. 
That's why a couple of months ago I've changed the settings so now only 
the mailing list address appears. And also in order to post - you have 
to register otherwise very quickly it's getting flooded with spam.
I hope this is not inconvenient - all the posts are signed anyway.

Regards
Svilen

Hi Sergey,

Please patch the trunk with the updates. Otherwise there is a risk to 
forget about the fix and the bug might reappear in the next release. 
Ideally when we're not in a "release state" I would prefer to have all 
changes first in the trunk and then in the branches.

Thanks&Regards
Svilen

Bug #15280, was updated on 2009-Feb-16 23:13
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: toped
Category: TELL script
Status: Open
Resolution: None
Bug Group: feature request
Priority: 5
Submitted by: s_krustev

Summary: String operations

Details: TELL lacks any string operations. Concatenation is the simplest an most obvious one, but search, delete and replacement will be also appropriate.

Hi Graham,

I had a look. The CIF file is fine. There is a problem with the 
conversion here. I don't want to get into details, but the bottom line 
is that I'm loosing precision during the CIF import and in the general 
case it might result in imprecise or even loss of data which would be a 
very serious flaw. It's fixable of course, but I'll need a couple of 
days on this. The assert will disappear and the crash with it, but it 
was placed there to catch this kind of problems.

One can argue of course that 15nm is out of the CIF precision, but 
that's certainly not the point. The point is the precision of the target 
DB (TDT) and it certainly takes this kind of sizes.

Thanks for the report. I'll keep you posted ...

Regards
Svilen

P.S. As I mentioned before, for a number of reasons the GDS conversion 
is more "natural" for Toped besides the code there is validated on a 
number of occasions and much more mature.
P.P.S. By the way you still have troubles getting the graphics running. 
A question - is your Ubuntu updated? I mean did you update your system 
recently?

Hi Graham,

There are some updates available - same place as before.
Now there should not be troubles with CIF precision. I did also some 
other updates you're asking for - not all of them though. From user 
point of view, the cifimport() function has now a new parameter which is 
used as a base for all text sizes.

It's too late , but instead of more explanations, I've created an 
alternative TELL file which is attached. Have a look when you have a time

Regards
Svilen

P.S. You'll need to update the "path" variable on line 83

Hi Svilen,
   Thks, I'll check it out.
   I solved my graphics problem. I switched off Compiz. Compiz was
also giving problems with the Alliance software graphics, which
although visible would crash easily.

Message-ID: <200902211339.n1LDdhpC024908@unicorn.berlios.de>

Bug #15300, was updated on 2009-Feb-21 13:39
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: toped
Category: TELL script
Status: Open
Resolution: None
Bug Group: bug
Priority: 5

Summary: Get rid of YYABORT in the parser

Details: We might need to introduce a status variable and check it on every step of the bison parsing. Using YYABORT proves to be a bad idea, because it's virtually impossible to restore the parser status without memory leakages and all other kinds of troubles in the following parser runs.

Subject: [Toped-development] Toped release schedule
Message-ID: <49A1485F.20200@googlemail.com>

Hi,

The next Toped release was planned as "consolidation" release. Currently 
however we're late with some of the originally planned updates and 
fixes. By default we're supposed to produce next release in 
February/March and here is the problem.

On one hand we do have already some important updates and fixes which 
will make a difference in a new release package. A release process 
however takes at least a week and this will put us even further behind 
the schedule. On the other hand it seems that we'll need another two or 
three months to cover at least the major tasks planned for this release.

I would appreciate your opinion

Regards
Svilen

If the improvements are significant as you say, then
release after 3 months.
As a user, what is tough is frequent releases which don't
bring much material advantage, but require testing with
various circuits to make sure nothing is broken.
If I don't think a new release brings enough advantage,
then I won't do the testing and I'll stick with the old one.

best regards, Graham Petley

OK,
let's postpone the next release for May and try to make it together with 
FC11 release. Having said that - I've merged the development of the new 
renderer to the trunk and also all the patch fixes (I think) scattered 
across the other branches.
Glew library (http://glew.sourceforge.net/ library) is now a new 
dependency - it shouldn't be a problem for the packaging I hope - it's 
already in the Fedora repository. It was also tested on XP and Vista.

I'll try to make some news updates on the web site during the weekend

Regards
Svilen
