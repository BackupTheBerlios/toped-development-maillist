Message-ID: <200907222115.n6MLFMHB000317@unicorn.berlios.de>

Summary: undo of removecell()

Details: removecell() undo has a principal problem. Here it is. When a cell is removed  from the target DB its contents is drained out (and stored in the attic lists) and then the empty cell is destroyed. This however is not good enough for proper undo. The reason is that the pointers to the cell definitions are kept in the cell references structure in the form of const_iterator to member of a list that contains all cells in the library. Removing (destroying) the member of that list is fatal. Here is the example:
select(); // select the last reference to the cell boza i.e. boza is not referenced anywhere
delete(); //
removecell("boza");
undo(); // this is OK, it works
undo(); // it will crash here
Similar effect will be if instead of removecell() ungroup() is used. As explained above the problem is rather general. We either need to change the type of the pointer to a cell definition (in the cell reference object) or have to introduce a placeholder to store deleted cell definitions in the Attick. Or (most likely) both.

Summary: new filllayer() tell function

Details: Currently there is no way to which the layer fill on/off. A TELL function should be defined which should work similarly to locklayer()/hidelayer()
Here is the initial idea:
filllayer(<list_of_layers>, <on_off>);
Function should have undo functionality.

Subject: [Toped-development] Incomming release
Message-ID: <4A68ED41.2050003@tiscali.co.uk>

Hi,
As communicated on the site the next release is due at the end of this 
month. We're already quite late with it, yet not everything that we've 
spend our time on during the last 9 months is completely ready.
- There is a certain amount of code which is not yet  merged to the main 
development trunk - calibre error report parser. The suggestion is to do 
that after the release. I prefer to postpone some features instead of 
sacrificing stability at this stage.
- There is also a code that is already in, but not quite finished and 
tested yet. The suggestion here is simply not to advertise those 
features and where they can be hit by chance - stub the entry points.
- All hands now should be on the bug and feature list logged in Berlios. 
Here also we won't be able to finish everything, so here is the priority 
list

016031:    undo of removecell()    (Crash)
015937:    part select/unselect behave differently (Bug)
016039:    new filllayer() tell function    (feature request)
016038:    Update the layer panel    (feature request)
014684:    Missing cells during import (feature request)
015040:    Toped properties    TELL script  (feature request)
014688:    Separate line properties (feature request)
014663:    convert wire to polygon/box   (feature request)

The rest of the entries shall remain open at this stage. Meanwhile all 
crashes and critical issues should be logged in Berlios. The plan is to 
make a release branch at the end of next week. This implies that we'll 
be able to make the release at the first days of August the earliest.

Another points of concern:
- Fedora 11. I haven't had a chance to switch yet (form Fedora 10) and 
obviously shall do that before the release. A points of particular 
interest are the graphic drivers and especially the one from Mesa. How 
they work with the old and the new renderer. Here I would be able to 
test then only on nVidia card.
- glew - it's a new external library dependency which may cause troubles 
with the packaging
- PLT Scheme (http://download.plt-scheme.org/) - another dependency, 
this time required by our first utility - virtuoso2tll. The concern here 
is :
-- are there already packages which will fit into FEL
-- how we'll distribute the utility for the windows package

Probably there is more, but it's more than enough for now.

Regards
Svilen

Summary: GDS can't be imported is target DB doesn't exists

Details: If gdsimport(...) is requested when a target DB is not existing, Toped reports an error:
"No active database. Create or load one"
This is unnecessary and annoying for the user.
In this case a taget DB has to be created automatically.
