Subject: [Toped-development] Bugfix release (multi gigabyte stream files)
Message-ID: <4AB7F8A6.9020604@googlemail.com>

Hi,
It has been some time since our 0.94 release. It looks to me that it's a 
time to make a bugfix release. Number of fixes are already submitted in 
the trunk. They are related to:

- Linux packaging
- Stability with various graphic drivers
- Multithread related locks
- GDS conversion

The latter is probably the main reason to produce the release. I spent 
last four weeks chasing the troubles with the conversion of multi 
gigabyte stream files. The conversion bottleneck was found and resolved. 
It's a relief to say that the problem was not principal - it was rather 
stupid. Toped converts such kind of files within minutes now.

Profiling the code with such amount of data prove to be quite a fun, but 
this is a different subject.

I'll appreciate your opinion about a quick release, so we can summarise 
the remaining tasks and nail down the schedule.

Regards
Svilen

Hello Svilen,

I'll appreciate if you could release it before 20 October at latest so
that I can add it into the FEL 12 Livedvd. We are reaching final
Freeze pretty soon.

I've written FEL release notes and added a page about Toped. If you
fill I've missed something please do comment :)

Hi Chitlesh,

That was my "secret" though.  I hope the release will happen in two 
weeks time max.
I read the release notes and I was thinking about some comments. Will do 
soon.

Thanks
Svilen
