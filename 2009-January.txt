Subject: [Toped-development] [Bug #14991] Objects rotated on non orthogonal
	angles are not visualised
Message-ID: <200901021213.n02CD1K2000006@unicorn.berlios.de>

Bug #14991, was updated on 2009-Jan-02 12:13
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: toped
Category: Graphics
Status: Open
Resolution: None
Bug Group: bug
Priority: 5
Submitted by: s_krustev
Assigned to : s_krustev
Summary: Objects rotated on non orthogonal angles are not visualised 

Details: Roated cells could dissapear from the screen. The easiest way to highlight the problem is to create a cell which overlaps a sqare area. When such kind of cell is placed with 45 degree rotation it could never be visualised.

I don't know who to atach example in the Berlios bug DB (is it possible?) -
so the mailing list will be used instead. The attached GDS demonstrates 2
bugs:

14982<http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&bug_id=14982&group_id=5037>:
Exception after deleting a cell instance
14991<http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&bug_id=14991&group_id=5037>:
Objects rotated on non orthogonal angles are not visualised

See the bug logs for further info

Subject: [Toped-development] [Bug #15040] Toped properties
Message-ID: <200901101449.n0AEnZgw023739@unicorn.berlios.de>

Bug #15040, was updated on 2009-Jan-10 14:49
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: toped
Category: TELL script
Status: Open
Resolution: None
Bug Group: feature request
Priority: 5
Submitted by: s_krustev
Assigned to : none
Summary: Toped properties

Details: We need a TELL function for a number of Toped specific properties. For example
 - Depth of undo buffer
 - Minimum visible area
List will grow. The idea is to create a pair of functions
settopedprop( ... );
gettopedprop( ... );

The parameter can be discussed, but the first idea is to be something like:
{"MIN_VISUAL_AREA", 25} i.e.
{"<parameter_name>", <value>}
