<PRE>Hi,

After the previous release Chitlesh reported some rpmlint/ldd warnings. 
I know it has been some time, but better late than never :)

shared-lib-calls-exit: (<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/toped-development/2008-November/000083.html">https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/toped-development/2008-November/000083.html</A>)

- libtpd_common - they were comming from the font library glf.cpp. Located in functions which have never been in use. There is no intention to use them - so I simply commented the offending code out.
- libtpd_parser - coming from the flex generated code for the tell scanner. exit() was called due to a critical runtime error. This was replaced using the macros YY_FATAL_ERROR and is not throwing an exception which is caught at the appropriate thread where the tell parser is invoked.
- libtpd_ifaces - same as above, but for the CIF scanner.


unused-direct-shlib-dependency: (<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/toped-development/2008-November/000084.html">https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/toped-development/2008-November/000084.html</A>)

- I've followed the gentoo recommendations (thanks fo the link) and added a line in the configure.ac. I believe that the two lines below in the spec line are redundant and can be removed now

&gt;<i> # clean unused-direct-shlib-dependencies sed -i -e 's! -shared ! 
</I>&gt;<i> -Wl,--as-needed\0!g' libtool 
</I>

Bottom line - RPM's should be clean from this kind of warnings now.
More clean-up's are comming

Regards
Svilen

P.S. Berilos is down for an hour now. Can't commit, can't do anything...

</PRE>
