<PRE>After 3 months delay from the usual schedule and some unpleasant experience with our host site over the weekend, we're finally happy to announce that Toped 0.9.4 has been released and is now available for download at Berlios.
<A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=5037&amp;release_id=16562">http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=5037&amp;release_id=16562</A> &lt;<A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/projects/toped">http://developer.berlios.de/projects/toped</A>&gt;

The Windows installation package will be available within 24 hours.

This release was planned as a consolidation release. Despite this there are significant updates and changes

The release highlights:
    * New graphic renderer which speeds-up the drawing up-to 3.5 times. Requires openGL version 1.4 and Virtual Buffer Objects. Will be used as a base for future graphical effects.
    * The old renderer remains to cover graphic drivers implementing older openGL versions and particularly virtual desktops. The speed here is also improved significantly.
    * Updates and fixes in the external interfaces. GDSII in particular.
    * New utility for conversion of Virtuoso(C) technology files to TELL.
    * TDT format updated with new records. Version updated to 0.7. Old Toped releases will not be able to read TDT files produced by this release. This release should handle silently both versions.
    * Significant provisions on improving the GDSII conversion speed. This task together with the reducing of the memory footprint is not finished though.
    * Further updates on the user interface customization - toolbars
    * Updates in the internal handling of the cell references. In result layer 0 is handled as a normal layer now.
    * Number of bug fixes

The site will be updated in the following days.
