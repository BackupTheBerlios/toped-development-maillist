<PRE>Hi,

After the latest troubles with berlios.de which are not over yet, I've 
started thinking about changing the source hosting site. To be honest - 
that's not a new idea, but recently it's getting more and more clear. 
Here are the obvious alternatives as I can see them:

1. sourceforge (<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/">http://sourceforge.net/</A>)
2. google code (<A HREF="http://code.google.com/projecthosting/">http://code.google.com/projecthosting/</A>)

Now, after the release - it seems to be the best time for doing such a 
thing. A week or two from now we'll be deeply into something new and 
just waiting for the next trouble to happen. As usual - there is no 
explanation whatsoever on their site. I've raised a bug 
(<A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&amp;bug_id=16088&amp;group_id=1">http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&amp;bug_id=16088&amp;group_id=1</A>). 
Hopefully the reply will come soon. Curiously enough - there is no bugs 
submitted there for more than a week.

What an eventual move will involve.
- Stop the development for several days
- Transfer the SVN database to the new host (that's the part I'm a bit 
afraid of)
- Transfer the bug tracking DB. Most likely we'll loose the closed 
issues, the open ones will have to be transferred manually.
- Updating the toped.org.uk with the new links.
- closing the project on berlios

For the developers:
- switch the local copies to the new repository
- the above will involve inevitably troubles with ssh certificates, 
passwords
- switch to a new mailing list

For users:
- The trouble is that the active contributors will have to re-subscribe 
to a new mailing list. In this process unfortunately we might loose some 
of them.

Having a quick look my sympathies seem to be with google. Their services 
are under development yet it looks like they have everything we need.

I'll appreciate your feedback
Regards
Svilen
