<PRE>Hi,
Over the last couple of days the project was effectively transferred to 
a new host:

<A HREF="http://toped.googlecode.com">http://toped.googlecode.com</A>

The subversion data base took ~12 hours to move, nevertheless without 
troubles.
The open bugs were transferred manually to the new bug tracking system 
offered by googlecode
The wiki pages were also transferred from <A HREF="http://toped.wikispaces.com/">http://toped.wikispaces.com/</A>

I've already committed a couple of code updates - everything seems to be 
fine.

Sergey, Sandesh - you're already added to the project members. Please 
check-out a fresh local svn copies using the instructions here:
<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/toped/source/checkout">http://code.google.com/p/toped/source/checkout</A>
Don't try svn switch - it won't work because the svn DBs on berlios and 
google have different IDs
Please no more commits to berlios. All code updates shall be submitted 
from now on to the new host. Let me know if you have troubles.

Web site will be updated over the weekend. I'll try to request a project 
close on berlios, but not quite sure how and when this might happen.

Please feel free to browse trough our new home. There are some 
interesting opportunities which are new for us (Code review, wiki etc.). 
I'll be happy to hear your comments and feedback.

Remaining activity : new public mailing list - I'll drop a follow-up as 
soon as we have one. Until then - please use the current mailing list.

Regards
Svilen

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After the latest troubles with berlios.de which are not over yet, I've 
</I>&gt;<i> started thinking about changing the source hosting site. To be honest 
</I>&gt;<i> - that's not a new idea, but recently it's getting more and more 
</I>&gt;<i> clear. Here are the obvious alternatives as I can see them:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. sourceforge (<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/">http://sourceforge.net/</A>)
</I>&gt;<i> 2. google code (<A HREF="http://code.google.com/projecthosting/">http://code.google.com/projecthosting/</A>)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, after the release - it seems to be the best time for doing such a 
</I>&gt;<i> thing. A week or two from now we'll be deeply into something new and 
</I>&gt;<i> just waiting for the next trouble to happen. As usual - there is no 
</I>&gt;<i> explanation whatsoever on their site. I've raised a bug 
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&amp;bug_id=16088&amp;group_id=1">http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&amp;bug_id=16088&amp;group_id=1</A>). 
</I>&gt;<i> Hopefully the reply will come soon. Curiously enough - there is no 
</I>&gt;<i> bugs submitted there for more than a week.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What an eventual move will involve.
</I>&gt;<i> - Stop the development for several days
</I>&gt;<i> - Transfer the SVN database to the new host (that's the part I'm a bit 
</I>&gt;<i> afraid of)
</I>&gt;<i> - Transfer the bug tracking DB. Most likely we'll loose the closed 
</I>&gt;<i> issues, the open ones will have to be transferred manually.
</I>&gt;<i> - Updating the toped.org.uk with the new links.
</I>&gt;<i> - closing the project on berlios
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For the developers:
</I>&gt;<i> - switch the local copies to the new repository
</I>&gt;<i> - the above will involve inevitably troubles with ssh certificates, 
</I>&gt;<i> passwords
</I>&gt;<i> - switch to a new mailing list
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For users:
</I>&gt;<i> - The trouble is that the active contributors will have to 
</I>&gt;<i> re-subscribe to a new mailing list. In this process unfortunately we 
</I>&gt;<i> might loose some of them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Having a quick look my sympathies seem to be with google. Their 
</I>&gt;<i> services are under development yet it looks like they have everything 
</I>&gt;<i> we need.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll appreciate your feedback
</I>&gt;<i> Regards
</I>&gt;<i> Svilen
