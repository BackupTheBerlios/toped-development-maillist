<PRE>
Now when the CIF parser is functional, I'm facing a couple of questions 
concerning CIF to TDT conversion

2 step conversion.
It appears that a 2 step conversion is going to be needed: parse - 
convert. It is a bit funny, because CIF according to its authors is 
supposed to be processed in a single pass, but this doesn't appear to be 
feasible - see below.

Layer numbers.
CIF defines layers only by name (up to 4 letter string). I found nothing 
neither in the format nor in the user extensions that would make the 
correspondence between a layer name and the GDSII (or TDT) layer number. 
This means that the layer correspondence have to be defined before the 
conversion or at least after the first pass. It can be done in the 
following ways:
1. Separate TELL command - for example :
    defineciflay(&quot;&lt;cif name&gt;&quot;, &lt;tdt number&gt;);
2. To add a parameter to layprop function:
    layprop(&quot;&lt;tdt name&gt;&quot; , &lt;tdt layer number&gt;  ,&quot;&lt;colour&gt;&quot; ,&quot;&lt;fill&gt;&quot; , 
&quot;&lt;sel. line style&gt;&quot;, &lt;cif name&gt; );
3. To have a parameter in the conversion function defining layer 
correspondence. The layer correspondence then can be defined using TELL:
   struct CIFlays {string cifname; int tdtlayno};
  CIFlays list cif_layer_definition = {{&quot;L01&quot;, 1},{&quot;L04&quot;, 4},{&quot;L08&quot;, 
8},{&quot;L07&quot;, 7}};
   cifimport(&lt;top_structure&gt;, cif_layer_definition);

Cell names.
Unlike layers the cells in CIF have an associated number, not a name. 
Besides it is possible to undefine a cell which implies that technically 
cells with the same number can be redefined and coexist within a certain 
CIF file. There is an user extension of the format which binds a name to 
the cell definition, but this is not mandatory - it is rather a good 
will. The question here is do we need a &quot;dictionary&quot; for the cell names?
1. cifread returns the &quot;dictionary&quot; extracted from the CIF file. Toped 
suggest cell names (based on cell numbers) in case there are no cell 
names defined. The dictionary can be edited and then handled as a 
parameter of cifimport function.
2. No dictionary, Toped generate cell names according to an internal 
algorithm based on cell numbers. Cell names parsed from the CIF file are 
preserved in all cases.

Cell hierarchy and Layout data outside a cell.
Is is perfectly legal ( mandatory ? ) in CIF to have layout data outside 
a cell. This data must be converted to some kind of a cell. The only 
suggestion here is to create a cell with the name of the file. He good 
news is that this resolves automatically the question about the top 
level structure.
1. Do we need top level cell name (number) as an input parameter to 
cifimport ?
2. Do we have to visualize the CIF cell hierarchy after the first pass?

The last two points require a robust algorithm to avoid cell name clashes.

Comments? Preferences? Ideas?
