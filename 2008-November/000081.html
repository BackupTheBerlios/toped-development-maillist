<PRE>Hi,

It seems a proper time to share some thoughts and discuss some ideas 
about the next Toped release.

We do have some major development threads in the &quot;official&quot; TODO list, 
nevertheless it seems that it's a time to look around and make sure that 
the existing features are really finished, stable and usable. In other 
words it seems that we have to spend some time to consolidate and polish 
the existing features. Here is what I mean

Undocumented or unusable features.
- PostScript output. It exists for a couple of releases now. Not fully 
tested, not included in the menus, not documented, no examples etc.
- Screen snapshots. Some restrictions on the correct image generation, 
nevertheless it's there for some time now, but not included in the 
menus, not documented, no examples etc.
- User drawing optimisation - cell depth visibility, minimum object size 
visibility etc. - it's all there, but has to be wrapped with tell 
commands and user menus or dialogue boxes
- Controllable undo depth - same as above.

User interface. There is a lot of potential in the UI framework, but 
still some missing parts on it's way to &quot;rise &amp; shine&quot;.
- Customisable menu. It is there, but we didn't really advertise it, it 
is vaguely mentioned on the web site, no examples, no tll files with 
real configurations.
- Customisable toolbars. Some tell functions are missing there to 
achieve the planned functionality.
- Layer panel. Pretty much there, but still needs some attention and 
some polishing.
- Cell browser panel. Functionality is significantly improved in the 
last release, but still some odd behavior can be observed during &quot;edit 
in place&quot;.
- Status line. Updated occasionally.
- tell lib panel. Missing documentation links of the build-in TELL 
functions.
- Dialogue boxes. Effectively all of them need polishing. We need to 
make sure that they look as expected on all platforms. Some of them (for 
example layer/fill/color definition) are very basic and require more 
substantial attention.

OpenGL drawing. The graphic hardware became powerful yet relatively 
cheap and accessible these days. We need to use the graphic hardware 
more intensively - this means to explore an alternative way of drawing 
keeping the existing one and giving the user a choice which one to use.

Multithreading. Although fairly stable, some locking can still be 
observed and depending on the platform it can be irritating.
- Main troubles are coming from the synchronisation of the cell browser 
panel with the database.
- Semaphores that we use need polishing and some additional features to 
give more control and visibility to the user.
- The openGL drawing which now is executed in the main thread should be 
launched in a separate thread.
- Still some situations (long GDSII conversions for example) which 
freeze the entire Toped window.Need investigation and updates.

Recovery. Needs more extensive and focused debugging to make sure that 
all individual TELL functions are executed properly in recovery mode.

TELL parser.
- Requires some relatively simple additions to give more visibility and 
control to the user. For example: Report/Clear variables or function 
definitions.
- Some additions to the lists and structures to make them more usable. 
Static typecasting to help the parser to recognise more complex 
anonymous structures.

In addition to all this it seems a good idea to add some libraries. They 
can be shipped/downloaded separately from the release. I mean
- Digital cell library directly in TDT format.
- library of TELL functions

All the above is telling to me that the next release should be a 
&quot;consolidation&quot; release. Nothing really new from development point of 
view. It looks like a long list and it is not full. Nevertheless most of 
the tasks require relatively little effort yet they will help to improve 
the overall stability and appearance of Toped.
