Subject: [Toped-development] Issues on Fedora 9
Message-ID: <48487B7A.8090605@googlemail.com>


Hi

We have a number of issues with the latest Fedora 9 release.

It was reported by the packagers first (thanks Chitlesh) that Toped is
crashing at startup. The root problem there appears to be the lack of
error handling if we can't initialize GL with required attributes - see
MBug 78. Curiously enough the GL initialization is working with a number
of fedora releases, but not with fc9.

On top of this there is also an issue with the visualization of the
interactive commands. This has to be still investigated - usually the
reason for this kind of troubles is the double buffering

It seems that both issues are coming down to the state of the mesa
library(7.1 pre-release) used in FC9 release. I didn't try ATI or nVidia
drivers to confirm this.

Independently of the above there are also a couple of more known bugs
(see  MBug 76) in 0.9 release. It appears that a bugfix release is
pending as soon as we get those fixed.

Regards
Svilen

Hi Chitlesh,

It seems that I fixed the immediate problem that causes the crashes, 
nevertheless I wanted to double check a couple of more things and I'll 
appreciate your help.

I was wondering whether you(or somebody else)  tried to run Toped 0.9 on 
Fedora 9 with nVidia or ATI . I saw on the web that nVidia released 
their dirvers - didn't see anything about ATI (my card is ATI). This is 
just to double-check that it starts-up properly even without the fix.

By the way - I was wondering whether mesa was used when you're doing the 
packages for previous Fedora releases. The problem seems to be there for 
quite some time.

Regards
Svilen

Chitlesh,

I've created a patch containing some fixes. It is supposed to help for 
FC9 package.
The patch can be downloaded here
http://download.berlios.de/toped/release_0.9_patch_652_678.patch

As I mentioned - I'm away for a week starting from Tuesday, so you have 
a day left to come back with your questions :)
OK, seriously speaking -  Sergey can help, so feel free to post your 
questions here.

Regards
Svilen
