I currently don't have enough time to look at it. I would appreciate
if you could look whether there are some missing headers somewhere.

Hi Chitlesh,
There must be some kind of mistake here. Are you sure that you've 
checked-out  RELEASE_0.94_CAND?
The thing is that the files tedop.cpp and tedop.h were removed from the 
repository somewhere between 0.86 and 0.9 release. This is a couple of 
years ago.

I do sit still on Fedora 10, nevertheless... Would you double check?

Regards
Svilen

You are right svilen, It's my fault

However on launching this RC, I get a dialog box stating
"openGL version 1.4 is not supported"

Report video from toped :
<= Vendor:Tungsten Graphics, Inc.
<= Renderer:Mesa DRI R100 (RV200 4C57) 20090101 x86/MMX/SSE2 TCL DRI2
<= Version:1.3 Mesa 7.6-devel
<= GLX version 12
<= Using GLEW 1.5.1

attached is the RPM spec file


Also, I would recommend you to add the following into the "make
install" process, hence other distributions can also benefit from the
icons on the menus:

%{__mkdir} -p %{buildroot}%{_datadir}/icons/hicolor/16x16/apps/
%{__cp} -p ui/%{name}_16x16.png

Typo: remove the "a"

Hi Chitlesh,

See the comments below

That's OK. This is to say that the "old" renderer will be used, which is 
slower (faster than it was before, but still slower than the "new" one). 
I believe with a vendor driver this will not be the case. You can see in 
the video report, that openGL version is 1.3. New renderer is using 
virtual buffer objects which were introduced in 1.4 (current openGL 
version is 3.0 :) )
This should not affect stability so - Toped should work as normal. Note, 
this has nothing to do with the problems we had previously with the 
accumulation buffer. It should not require any changes in the X 
configuration.

I accept this. We've approached the point where a proper icon theme 
management is essential. Actually I need help here all along. Starting 
with the icons themselves ( current icons are considered temporary) and 
finishing with their proper installation. I google the problem and found 
a couple of links
http://live.gnome.org/ThemableAppSpecificIcons
http://live.gnome.org/GnomeGoals/AppIcon
Will appreciate more if you have something in mind. The impression is 
that we need to take the problem seriously and my intention is to to 
look for help. At the moment though - the suggestion is to keep the 
current status for this release.

Subject: [Toped-development] rpmlint/ldd errors & warnings
Message-ID: <4A74BBEF.5030805@tiscali.co.uk>

Hi,

After the previous release Chitlesh reported some rpmlint/ldd warnings. 
I know it has been some time, but better late than never :)

shared-lib-calls-exit: (https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/toped-development/2008-November/000083.html)

- libtpd_common - they were comming from the font library glf.cpp. Located in functions which have never been in use. There is no intention to use them - so I simply commented the offending code out.
- libtpd_parser - coming from the flex generated code for the tell scanner. exit() was called due to a critical runtime error. This was replaced using the macros YY_FATAL_ERROR and is not throwing an exception which is caught at the appropriate thread where the tell parser is invoked.
- libtpd_ifaces - same as above, but for the CIF scanner.


unused-direct-shlib-dependency: (https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/toped-development/2008-November/000084.html)

- I've followed the gentoo recommendations (thanks fo the link) and added a line in the configure.ac. I believe that the two lines below in the spec line are redundant and can be removed now

> # clean unused-direct-shlib-dependencies sed -i -e 's! -shared ! 
> -Wl,--as-needed\0!g' libtool 


Bottom line - RPM's should be clean from this kind of warnings now.
More clean-up's are comming

Regards
Svilen

P.S. Berilos is down for an hour now. Can't commit, can't do anything...

Subject: [Toped-development] Toped 0.9.4 tarball released
Message-ID: <4A777AD1.6090701@googlemail.com>

After 3 months delay from the usual schedule and some unpleasant experience with our host site over the weekend, we're finally happy to announce that Toped 0.9.4 has been released and is now available for download at Berlios.
http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=5037&release_id=16562 <http://developer.berlios.de/projects/toped>

The Windows installation package will be available within 24 hours.

This release was planned as a consolidation release. Despite this there are significant updates and changes

The release highlights:
    * New graphic renderer which speeds-up the drawing up-to 3.5 times. Requires openGL version 1.4 and Virtual Buffer Objects. Will be used as a base for future graphical effects.
    * The old renderer remains to cover graphic drivers implementing older openGL versions and particularly virtual desktops. The speed here is also improved significantly.
    * Updates and fixes in the external interfaces. GDSII in particular.
    * New utility for conversion of Virtuoso(C) technology files to TELL.
    * TDT format updated with new records. Version updated to 0.7. Old Toped releases will not be able to read TDT files produced by this release. This release should handle silently both versions.
    * Significant provisions on improving the GDSII conversion speed. This task together with the reducing of the memory footprint is not finished though.
    * Further updates on the user interface customization - toolbars
    * Updates in the internal handling of the cell references. In result layer 0 is handled as a normal layer now.
    * Number of bug fixes

Subject: [Toped-development] Toped 0.9.4 windows package released
Message-ID: <4A78B636.2050105@tiscali.co.uk>


As promised yesterday windows installation package of Toped 0.9.4 is now 
released and available for download.

http://toped.org.uk/download/release-0.9.4/toped_install-0.94r1163.exe

Unfortunately, the troubles with our host berlios.de are not behind. It 
appears that their ftp service is silent today. We were forced to put 
the entire release directly on the web site (which is not hosted by 
berlios.de). To download the packages of this release - please use the 
new links provided on the web site www.toped.org.uk. If and when 
berlios.de finally starts functioning reliably our web site will be 
updated accordingly. Sorry for the inconvenience.

Subject: [Toped-development] How about host changing ?
Message-ID: <4A78CF1E.3070709@tiscali.co.uk>

Hi,

After the latest troubles with berlios.de which are not over yet, I've 
started thinking about changing the source hosting site. To be honest - 
that's not a new idea, but recently it's getting more and more clear. 
Here are the obvious alternatives as I can see them:

1. sourceforge (http://sourceforge.net/)
2. google code (http://code.google.com/projecthosting/)

Now, after the release - it seems to be the best time for doing such a 
thing. A week or two from now we'll be deeply into something new and 
just waiting for the next trouble to happen. As usual - there is no 
explanation whatsoever on their site. I've raised a bug 
(http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&bug_id=16088&group_id=1). 
Hopefully the reply will come soon. Curiously enough - there is no bugs 
submitted there for more than a week.

What an eventual move will involve.
- Stop the development for several days
- Transfer the SVN database to the new host (that's the part I'm a bit 
afraid of)
- Transfer the bug tracking DB. Most likely we'll loose the closed 
issues, the open ones will have to be transferred manually.
- Updating the toped.org.uk with the new links.
- closing the project on berlios

For the developers:
- switch the local copies to the new repository
- the above will involve inevitably troubles with ssh certificates, 
passwords
- switch to a new mailing list

For users:
- The trouble is that the active contributors will have to re-subscribe 
to a new mailing list. In this process unfortunately we might loose some 
of them.

Having a quick look my sympathies seem to be with google. Their services 
are under development yet it looks like they have everything we need.

I'll appreciate your feedback
Regards
Svilen

Hi,
Over the last couple of days the project was effectively transferred to 
a new host:

http://toped.googlecode.com

The subversion data base took ~12 hours to move, nevertheless without 
troubles.
The open bugs were transferred manually to the new bug tracking system 
offered by googlecode
The wiki pages were also transferred from http://toped.wikispaces.com/

I've already committed a couple of code updates - everything seems to be 
fine.

Sergey, Sandesh - you're already added to the project members. Please 
check-out a fresh local svn copies using the instructions here:
http://code.google.com/p/toped/source/checkout
Don't try svn switch - it won't work because the svn DBs on berlios and 
google have different IDs
Please no more commits to berlios. All code updates shall be submitted 
from now on to the new host. Let me know if you have troubles.

Web site will be updated over the weekend. I'll try to request a project 
close on berlios, but not quite sure how and when this might happen.

Please feel free to browse trough our new home. There are some 
interesting opportunities which are new for us (Code review, wiki etc.). 
I'll be happy to hear your comments and feedback.

Remaining activity : new public mailing list - I'll drop a follow-up as 
soon as we have one. Until then - please use the current mailing list.

Regards
Svilen

It is all done now. The project is completely moved to its new home and 
www.toped.org.uk is updated with the new links.
New mailing list is created, developers are subscribed. The rest of the 
subscribers of the old mailing list I believe received an invitation to 
re-subscribe. If that's not the case - please use the links provided on 
the web site.

Sorry for the noise & inconvenience everybody!

Hi

I checked SVN. It works fine.
Only one thing. I didn't find the way to change generated password to my
own.

Ready to continue.

Any feedback from users about new release?

Sergey
