different variables. But you are right. This is a not so important.

either internally in the toped engine (1,2) or in a TELL variable (3).<br>

For example hide some inessential layers (N+, P+ etc) and concentrate only a
few important layers (active, poly, contact) for rapid layout development.
Then show all layers and add missing data.
It can be easily realized by adding add/show functions for layer tab and by
using TELL.
