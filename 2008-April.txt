Subject: [Toped-development] 0.9 release branch
Message-ID: <47F56EA7.4020100@googlemail.com>


I've created a branch for release 0.9.
As usual - it shall be used for critical bug fixes before& after the 
release.

We are a month behind the schedule, but everything planned is 
implemented. New features will be listed in the release message.

The idea is to release the tarball in the beginning of the next week. 
Web site will be updated in parallel.

There are no dependency changes.
There are resource updates ( icons ) which will have to be installed 
properly. RPM build configuration file require update.

Regards
Svilen
