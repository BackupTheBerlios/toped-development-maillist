<PRE>Hi,
After spending more than two months attempting to optimize and primarily 
to speed-up the existing openGL rendering it seems that it might be a 
good idea to share the experience. Hopefully it will save some time and 
confusion in the future (long e-mail ahead!).

The idea behind the optimisation was that current drawing is using:
 - data copy during rendering.
 - data translations i.e. calculations during rendering
 - only the most basic OpenGL functions (glBegin {glVertex} glEnd).
 - data is transferred &quot;per point&quot; basis to the graphic card. No bursts.
On the positive side - this type of rendering
 - doesn't need any additional sorting
 - doesn't need additional memory (to store the sorted data)
 - very simple implementation

The new renderer was supposed to address the issues above thus achieving 
better rendering speeds.
 - no data copying.
 - all coordinate translations are done by openGL.
 - using of theoretically more effective vertex arrays and corresponding 
drawing functions (glMultiDrawArrays, glMultiDrawElements)
 - data is transferred and drawn &quot;per cell layer&quot; basis i.e. the entire 
cell layer is drawn with a couple of openGL function calls.
On the negative side - we're having
 - data sorting and storing during the rendering (to generate vertex arrays)
 - requires additional memory resources
 - more complex implementation

In both cases :
- the rendering is based on the same data base structure and the same 
data traversing.
- the main optimisation of the drawing time comes from the &quot;quadtree&quot; 
objects and the dynamic filtering that they implement.
- polygons and wires are tessellated during the rendering.

In addition the profiling of the old renderer was not trivial, because 
the drawing, data copying, processing and drawing was done effectively 
together. With the new renderer the profiling is more feasible. One more 
important point - it appeared impossible to completely avoid the data 
copying. Vertex arrays had to be filled-up with real data from the DB, 
nevertheless I did my best to optimize this process (possible further 
optimisation is to use vertex buffers).
Having both renderers up&amp;running the first thing was to compare their 
speed. I tested the optimised version with two databases - one pretty 
small (~2MB GDSII) and the other one - a bit larger (~65MB GDSII)
The result was not very encouraging - the difference of the rendering 
time is less than 10% and (what was really disappointing) not always in 
favour of the new render. This of course made me more curious and I 
spent some time trying to profile the new renderer... just to get 
another surprise:

                   Process                                :  time
-------------------------------------------------------------
DB Traversing                                        :  29%
Tessellation, sorting&amp; temporary storage:  59%
Data copying&amp; Drawing                         :  12%

Having in mind that the traversing is generally the same in both 
renderers and it is not the subject of the optimisation the first 
obvious conclusion was that the drawing time is pretty insignificant and 
further work there (shaders were planned) could be unnecessary at least 
from the point of view of drawing speed. The problem obviously comes 
from the time consumed by the tessellation, sorting and temporary storage.

OK - I did a quick step back and bypassed the vertex arrays and all of 
the corresponding sorting and temporary storage (this version is in 
OPENGL_DRAW3 branch). Now I had pretty much the same processing as in 
the original renderer, but without the data copying. Also the coordinate 
transformations were done strictly in the GPU unlike the old parser 
where most of them are calculated in the CPU. Theoretically this 
should've made some difference. Comparing the total rendering times 
however brought-up another surprise - there was practically no 
difference. It appears that the time consumed for the CPU calculations 
and copying of relatively small amounts of data is insignificant 
compared with the overall processing time. The reason here could be in 
the memory access (cache hits). With the data bases of this size we'll 
have inevitably cache misses and the data access time will dominate the 
overall processing time. If that's so, if data processing takes so 
insignificant time in the old renderer then why it takes so much time in 
the original implementation of the new renderer?

At this point it started to get interesting. I mentioned that if the 
fill is skipped, the drawing time is reduced more than twice in both 
renderers and they don't really have very much in common. Then I started 
to bypass the rendering of each data class (box, poly, wire) one by one 
and to look how it contributes to the overall drawing time. To cut the 
long story short it appeared that the tesselation of the polygons alone 
is totally dominating the &quot;Tessellation, sorting &amp; temporary storage&quot; 
time taking ~90% of it. In other words polygon tessellation alone was 
taking 50% of the total rendering time. Note that tessellation is 
bypassed in both renderers if the object (layer) is not filled.

It came as a real surprise for me, having in mind that statistically 
polygons are probably less than 25% of the total amount of the layout 
objects. Yet the way ahead seem to be clear now. I would happily bargain 
a couple of megabytes of RAM to cut the rendering time in half. Here are 
more details.
- polygon tessellation will be executed when a polygon is added to the 
DB or modified. The tessellation results will be stored in memory ready 
for rendering.
- convex polygons which do not require tessellation shall be stored in a 
separate new class of the data base. This will save some memory back and 
also could contribute to the rendering speed.
- having done the above, a new profiling has to be done, because the 
existing analysis appears now pretty much imprecise because of the 
dominance of a single factor.

Simples...

Cheers
Svilen
