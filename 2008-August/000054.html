<PRE>
As you know it was impossible to run toped on Fedora 9 with the original 
video drivers. Vendor drivers are still not officially available.
That is the reason why we still don't have an RPM in FC9 repositories. 
It was clear from the beginning that the problem was that toped can't 
obtain a GLX visual with accumulation buffers. They are used for the 
interactive graphics. A long investigation but finally something popped-up.

Your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file has to be updated as shown below

Section &quot;ServerLayout&quot;
        ...
        Option         &quot;GlxVisuals&quot; &quot;all&quot;
EndSection

This is proved working on a platform with the ATI graphic card. I have 
no information about nVidia platforms and whether the problem there was 
existing on the first place.

The bad news is that the graphics still doesn't seem to be at its best, 
so this is not the end of the road.

In case you need further info:
