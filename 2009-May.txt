Message-ID: <200905230004.n4N04sd7010412@unicorn.berlios.de>

Bug #15732, was updated on 2009-May-23 01:04
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: toped
Category: Crash
Status: Open
Resolution: None
Bug Group: bug
Priority: 5
Submitted by: s_krustev

Summary: Crash on selectall() function

Details: It crashes on assert @ line tedcell.cpp:1308
1307    delete ssl;
1308    assert(viewprop.layselmask() != laydata::_lmall);
if an array of cells is the only object in the current cell. There is no problem if the object is selected by double-click (calling different method of tedcell class)

It's most likely not a problem, but I need to refresh my memories about this assert and to update it eventually

Subject: [Toped-development] questions about the new renderer
Message-ID: <20090528231344.288380@gmx.net>

Hi Svlien,

I read your post on the new renderer from April with much interest.

Do you have an update on how your "pre-tesselate polygon" datastructure turned out ?
I'm assuming you're breaking down the polygons into trapezoids, right ?
What algorithm to you use ?

I'm working with GB sized gds'es, so a compact representation is really important.
Any thoughts on the "most compact" datastructure ?

1) This might be of interest to you. Keyword bindless graphics

2) opengl and server farms

My biggest problem with OpenGL is that I run programs on a server farm and use X to display on a windows machine. 
Either there is no fast OpenGL on the server or even worse it must be shared between several applications.

Any thoughts on this ?

3) chipmap
 
With regard to display speed and quality have a look at the work from Jeff Solomon http://velox.stanford.edu/~jsolomon/chipmap/

4) how does toped's memory footprint/render speed compare against the "other tools out there" ?

Stefan

There are two things I'm currently struggling to find a good reference for
a) an algorithm to grow/shring arbitrary polygons (the simpler the better, I don't need performance)
b) a description of the algorithm for rendering subpixel accurate aliased trapezoids

Subject: [Toped-development] [Bug #15775] GDS containing objects on layer 0
Message-ID: <200905292100.n4TL0oiL003762@unicorn.berlios.de>

Bug #15775, was updated on 2009-May-29 22:00

Summary: GDS containing objects on layer 0

Details: Layer 0 is used internally for reference representation. There is an assert in datacenter.cpp which is the immediate cause for the crash. GDS import seems to parse layer 0 properly without complaints.

> 163         }
> 164         wd = wd->last();

Having a look at gds documentation - it appears that 0 layer is legal. Curiously enough this problem was never seen before. Even more interesting is why I decided that layer 0 should not be used for ordinary layout objects.

The fix will require deeper changes in the DB organisation. The good news is that it will fulfil Sergey's requiest related to the SKILL convertor

Details: The library context menu in the cell browser panel is the same as for the cells. It is wrong and really confusing.
The browser needs at least two more icons for the target design, and the library
