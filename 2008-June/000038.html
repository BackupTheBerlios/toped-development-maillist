Hi Chitlesh,

It seems that I fixed the immediate problem that causes the crashes, 
nevertheless I wanted to double check a couple of more things and I'll 
appreciate your help.

I was wondering whether you(or somebody else)  tried to run Toped 0.9 on 
Fedora 9 with nVidia or ATI . I saw on the web that nVidia released 
their dirvers - didn't see anything about ATI (my card is ATI). This is 
just to double-check that it starts-up properly even without the fix.

By the way - I was wondering whether mesa was used when you're doing the 
packages for previous Fedora releases. The problem seems to be there for 
quite some time.

Regards
Svilen

</I>&gt;<i> It seems that both issues are coming down to the state of the mesa

</I>&gt;<i> drivers to confirm this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Independently of the above there are also a couple of more known bugs
