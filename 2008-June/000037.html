Hi

We have a number of issues with the latest Fedora 9 release.

It was reported by the packagers first (thanks Chitlesh) that Toped is
crashing at startup. The root problem there appears to be the lack of
error handling if we can't initialize GL with required attributes - see
MBug 78. Curiously enough the GL initialization is working with a number
of fedora releases, but not with fc9.

On top of this there is also an issue with the visualization of the
interactive commands. This has to be still investigated - usually the
reason for this kind of troubles is the double buffering

It seems that both issues are coming down to the state of the mesa
library(7.1 pre-release) used in FC9 release. I didn't try ATI or nVidia
drivers to confirm this.

Independently of the above there are also a couple of more known bugs
(see  MBug 76) in 0.9 release. It appears that a bugfix release is
pending as soon as we get those fixed.

Regards
Svilen
