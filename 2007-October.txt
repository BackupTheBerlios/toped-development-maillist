Subject: [Toped-development] toped 0.8.6 released
Message-ID: <470C1A4E.2000605@googlemail.com>

I just uploaded 0.8.6 release to Berlios.
Sorry for the 3 weeks delay!
Binary RPM's will not be available this time. For Fedora they will be in the repository - Chitlesh?

For windows we have an optimized executable this time (thanks to Sergey) which is significantly smaller in size and hopefully much more stable.

A tag release_0.8.6 is created in the repository. 
All the updates done in the release_0.8.6 branch are pached back to main - means the development can continue in the repository trunk.

Web site still has to be updated. An announcement shall be posted also in some forums.

Thanks & Regards

Yes, there will be. This weekend I'll build the rpm and push it to fedora.

However, I don't remember if I mentioned before,
"toped" is listed in my Fedora Electronic Lab.
http://chitlesh.fedorapeople.org/
http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/FedoraElectronicLab

There will be a special livecd for Fedora Electronic Lab, and toped will be on 
it: http://chitlesh.fedorapeople.org/FEL/livecd-fedora-electronic-lab.ks

Fedora 8 test 2 and test3 can be downloaded here 
http://torrent.fedoraproject.org/
under the name :
Fedora-8-Test-3-Live-FEL-i686.torrent
FEL for Fedora Electronic Lab

The final release will be on 8th november 2007.

congratulations svilen.
Chitlesh

Chitlesh,

Thanks for your fast reply and thanks again for the good news.

Concerning Fedora Electroninc Lab  - it seems that we can do some additional
work to integrate Tobed better in that packet. I spot that you're talking
about 0.13 process, libraries etc.
I can produce at least setup files for this particular library, not
mentioning that it would be nice to have the library converted in tdt format

What do you say about this?

Svilen
