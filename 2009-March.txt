Hello,

is it possible to release a "Release Candidate" very soon ?

I would appreciate if the final release would be out during the first
week of April. It will help me prepare the toped rpm properly and do
some testing as well. Also, we will be having the freeze very soon in
April, I hope to get it on the LiveDVD.

FYI: toped with nvidia

Chitlesh,

Sorry for the late answer. We'll see what we can do. I'm in the middle 
of something and right now the main development trunk is now quite 
appropriate to be even called "release candidate". I'll have you request 
in mind and let you know what's going on in a couple of weeks time.

Hope that's OK.

Regards
Svilen
