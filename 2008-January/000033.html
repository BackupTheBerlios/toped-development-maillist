<PRE> Hi all,

Thank you all for your attention !

Here i will have my special thanks to  Sergey Gaitukevich for his patients
adn replies .  :)

I will share my thoughts of this problem after successfully solved this
problem under help of Sergey Gaitukevich and Svilen Krustev.

I find the problem is totally due to *build version* of C++ Runtime library.
(sorry i can not tell exactly what type this version number is though i
think it is as i will explain later in this email). and the formal way of
solving this C++ Runtime Library problem is to install *Microsoft Visual C++
2005 SP1 Redistributable Package . *

The toped program which triggers error when opening is asking for Microsoft
CRT version  8.0. 50727.726. however, due to some problem of my Visual
Studio 2005,  there is no *.726 version of CRT installed in WinSxS directory
on my computer. (i do not know exactly why there is some files missing
though it still told me that installation is completed and success.
Unrelaible Microsoft!!)

So, the solution here is simply to check which version of Microsoft CRT your
toped program asks for and which version(s) you have in your Windows WinSxS
directory. Then, re-compiling toped using your existing CRT library OR
installing MS Visual C++ Redistributable Package to bring in newer version
of CRT library. I fixed it manully though i think is not encouraged to do
so.

Finally, it is a great lesson for me and hope it would help !

bset regards,


sincerely,

lulu
BTW,  Now the toped works well in my windows XP and i further tried toped
linux version during my new year vacation. Both are excellent !
