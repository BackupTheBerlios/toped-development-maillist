Subject: [Toped-development] [ Bug #14666 ] Slow graphics
Message-ID: <48F1327F.6010601@googlemail.com>

Hi,

You right. It looks too slow to me. I've been loading some bigger 
designs and optimized version is almost swift - both @ linix and windows.
This is important question. Toped is focused on graphic speed. Can we do 
the following:

1. Let's transfer this discussion to the mailing list - you'll find 
links on the web site. It will be much easier for everybody.
2. I will appreciate to have more information about your platform.
3. It would be great if you can send the GDS to test it myself. It's 
quite possible that it is a bug in the drawing algo. You can use the 
alternative address on the web site

As I mention we're preparing a release right now, so bug reports like 
that are really welcome.

Regards
Svilen

Hi,

If you zoom to Right upper corner to the example layout 45 degrees lines are drawn wrongly.
The snapshot view is attached.

Ercan,

Thanks for the feedback. It appears that you're in uncharted teritory. I 
never tried Toped on Vista (I don't have one) and as far as I'm aware 
Sergey is siting on XP as well.
Sergey?
What I know for sure is that the install package was compiled on XP. The 
good news from you is that it works on Vista. The drawing times of tens 
of seconds however are certainly not what we're working for.
There is no much point explaining to you that on other platforms Toped 
is much faster than that. It's much better if you see it yourself. 
Obviously we need somebody to spend some time on Vista and to 
investigate the problem. Could be anything even something as simple as 
recompilation on Vista.

OK, I'll make a bug out of your report. As I said though I don't have 
Vista unfortunately. Anybody willing to spend some time compiling Toped 
on Vista?

Regards
Svilen

P.S. Please hit "reply to all" button when you're mailing back to the 
mailing list. Otherwise only I'm getting the answer.

Hi,

I don't see the effect on XP and Linux.
I believe the picture is from Vista. I'll create another bug in Berlios.

Thanks!

One more clue. 
This case is shows up when the upper points of the polygon is out of drawing field.

Hi all

Unfortunately I also don't have Vista. I tried it with Toped once and it was
also confused for me.
See
https://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&group_id=5037&bug_id=14220

Ercan, can you try to draw some elements (box, poly, wire) in Toped?
If you can't see anything until screen been refreshed (zoom, scroll etc) ,
so this is the same bug.

BTW do you use any drivers for your video or use only default  settings from
Vista?

Sergey

Subject: [Toped-development] Updates to Berlios setups
Message-ID: <48FB5CE3.9010505@tiscali.co.uk>

Hi,

I spent some time with the setup of the Toped mailing list and bug data 
base in Berlios. The result form that should be:

     1. The address of the sender will not be in the e-mail anymore. 
Just the address of the mailing list.  This is suppose to prevent making 
unintentional "private" e-mail exchanges and to think which "reply" 
button to hit in your e-mail client or web page. Also I guess it is 
better to keep our addresses away from the spammers when possible.

    2. Bug database is suppose to send a notification to the mailing 
list always when a fresh bug is submitted. Until now this was not the 
case and some reports were left without attention for weeks. This seem 
to work but not quite as expected yet. I've raised a bug to Berlios 
admin and I hope they will take care. Here is the link:
http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&bug_id=14678&group_id=1

Please let me know if the setups can be improved further

Svilen

Fixed in rev 819.
Nothing really to note - a simple copy/paste problem. It wasn't found 'till now because none of the acceleration (menu/toolbox etc.) stuff is using those functions.

I think there might be some misunderstanding - sorry! That was suppose 
to be a bug, not a feature request.
I didn't mean to ask for addition of new buttons on the panel. I wanted 
simply to keep the items in some kind of order - by layer numbers is 
fine by me. As far as I can see you did fix that in rev. 817.
The bug is fixed and can be closed now.

This sounds like a good idea - especially these days with  hundreds of 
layers. Are we talking groups here or a hierarchy of groups? If I 
understand it properly this organization will concern predominantly the 
visualization in the layer panel. With one click/ command you want to 
lock/hide/ etc. a predefined group of layers?

It should be used for critical or annoying bug fixes before and after

The web site is also updated - mainly GDS and CIF interfaces - but not

I do not have any problems while drawing box,poly or wires.
I am using the default video driver comes from the Windows Update.
As you may know, OpenGL performance and other issues heavily depends on the graphics driver. 
My video card is basic card and I think it does not have any accelerator for OpenGL or other enhancements.
And this may be case for the slow graphics.

Hierarchy of layers too complicated for me ?
I think it must be user choice what to do. With hidelayerbutton function and
customable toolbar (in next version of Toped) user can easily realize groups
of layers.

Hi
I dug internet and found interesting link
http://www.intel.com/support/graphics/intel945gm/sb/CS-021517.htm
According this document to get hardware acceleretion on Mobile Intel(R) 945GM
Express Chipset Family
for OpenGl you must install separate video driver from Intel.
Beside it next version Toped will check harware support for OpenGL.

I installed the following driver. 
Still layouteditor is faster. 
One difference between the programs are the layer strips definitions. The performance of the drawing 
is very sensitive to the strips in both tools. 
In layouteditor the strips are pre-defined but in toped they are customizable. 

I should check with the same strips definitions but I could not find enough time for this.

Do you still have a drawing times in the range of tens of seconds?
Is there any improvement ? I'll appreciate some rough figures to get a 
better picture

Using the example layout in toped installation.
TOPED: After zooming to a place in FOLL layout, it takes 4-5 seconds to zoom all.
LAYOUTEDITOR: After zooming to a place in AMODUL layout (4xFOLL), it takes less than 1 second, to zoom all.
As I said, if layer strips are removed, toped is much faster. Almost comparable to layouteditor.


I'll configure both tools  to use same strips for same layers and compare the results. The difference may also come from the opengl libraries
the programs use. You are using wxWidgets implementation but layouteditor is using QT's implementation.

Do you still have a drawing times in the range of tens of seconds?
Is there any improvement ? I'll appreciate some rough figures to get a 
better picture

OK, 4-5 seconds is still too much, but is it's much closer.
Not sure what do you call layer strips - I guess it is the layer fill 
patterns. They certainly depend on the graphic hardware and without them 
the graphics will be certainly faster although the difference in time 
should be almost unnoticeable.

Concerning the QT/wxWidget differences - I don't think both of them have 
anything to do with openGL implementation. They are rather wrapping an 
openGL window, but all real graphic operations are actually bypassing 
them and going directly to openGL library (unless QT changed this recent 
couple of years?)

If there is a difference on this subject - it might be the openGL 
implementation itself used by both tools. It might be different for XP 
(which we use) and Vista. I don't know whether they are different and if 
they are what the differences are.

The rest should be differences between the way toped and layout editor 
are handling data to the graphic system. We do have some options which 
are not yet on the surface, but really for the project of  this size 
they shouldn't matter. 4-5 seconds for the optimised version of toped is 
still in times slower that the performance I'm having.

Ercan, I really do appreciate your effort on this subject.

Thanks!
