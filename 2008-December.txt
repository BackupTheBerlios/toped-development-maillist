Hello.

Let me introduce new tool that can help layout designers make first step to
Toped layout editor and save a lot of time during initial setup and
preparations.
Virtuoso2tll ? converter technology files from Virtuoso layout editor.
It will be included into next revision of Toped and now is available from
repository.
Virtuoso2tll is built into Toped but can be used like stand-alone tool.
Usage:
   Virtoso2tll  outputfile.tll displayfile1.drf  <displayfile2.drf?.>
techfile
where
   outputfile.tll                                  ? filename of output
tell-file, later it can be call from Toped.
   displayfile1.drf, displayfile2.drf  ?  - Virtuoso display files that
contain definitions of colors, stipples etc
   techfile                                        - virtuoso tech file.

Some notes and further improvments:
1. Toped and virtoso2tll  currently support only minimal feature set of
Virtuoso. Converter translates colors, stipples for layers that convert in
gds file
      (takes this information from     Virtuoso techfile).
2. Some translation problem is reflected in tell-code like comments. Please
check output tell- file.
3. Be carefully with gds-layer #0. It doesn't support Toped. Later this
layer will be converted to other number.
4. Doesn't realized gds-conversion mapping.

Now virtoso2tll needs a strong testing. Any feedback is highly appreciated.

Subject: [Toped-development] [Bug #14982] Exception after deleting a cell
	instance
Message-ID: <200812301650.mBUGogA4007843@unicorn.berlios.de>

Bug #14982, was updated on 2008-Dec-30 16:50
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: toped
Category: other
Status: Open
Resolution: None
Bug Group: bug
Priority: 5
Submitted by: s_krustev
Assigned to : s_krustev
Summary: Exception after deleting a cell instance

Details: The problem manifest itself in a relatively complex hierarchy when a cell with children is instantiated in more than one place in the hierarchy. This works fine untill you're try to delete the last instance of a child in such a cell. Toped fires an exception in the SGHierTree<TYPE>::removeParent. It has to be noted also that this works fine if the database is loaded from a TDT file. It fails if such a hierarchy has been created after GDS/CIF conversion or interactively.

Unfortunately I can't submit a GDS with the test case in this bug log.
