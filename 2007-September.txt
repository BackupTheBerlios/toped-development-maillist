Subject: [Toped-development] 0.86 release branch
Message-ID: <46DDCEDD.8010709@googlemail.com>

I've created a new branch in repository RELEASE_0.86_CAND
As usual it shall be used for critical bug fixes before and after the 
release.

Updating the web with the TELL additions is a major remaining activity. 
The plan is to release the tarball in the beginning of the next week. 
There are no configuration or dependency changes this time - so the packaging shall be trivial.



Regards
Svilen

I have some troubles with windows installation of toped.
I need a few days to solve this problem.
