Message-ID: <448F2D7F.7080502@tiscali.co.uk>

It's a pleasure to anounce that /Toped 0.8/ has been released.

/Toped/ is an open source cross-platform IC layout editor, based on 
openGL and wxWidgets. It defines a new layout command script and layout 
file format. /Toped/ is fully driven by a build-in /TELL/ interpreter. 
All operations are executed as a response to a /TELL/ command. Further 
information can be found at http://www.toped.org.uk

Among the new features are:
- GDSII output
- crash recovery
- customizable menus
- log and crash files location and policy
- environmental variables are now recognized and expanded in all 
functions working with files
- Introduction of user defined structures (records) in TELL.
- TELL function parser

The release includes also Fedora RPM's and Windows installation

Enjoy
Toped developers
