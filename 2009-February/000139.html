<PRE>Hi,

The next Toped release was planned as &quot;consolidation&quot; release. Currently 
however we're late with some of the originally planned updates and 
fixes. By default we're supposed to produce next release in 
February/March and here is the problem.

On one hand we do have already some important updates and fixes which 
will make a difference in a new release package. A release process 
however takes at least a week and this will put us even further behind 
the schedule. On the other hand it seems that we'll need another two or 
three months to cover at least the major tasks planned for this release.

I would appreciate your opinion

Regards
Svilen
