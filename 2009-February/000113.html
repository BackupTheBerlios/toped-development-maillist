<PRE>Hi Svilen,
   I checked my CIF files for the correct usage of the scaling
factor on the Definition Start (DS) line.

   With a 2um techno I have

DS 1 100 2;
L CCC;
B 4 4 10 126;

The scaling is 100/2=50 which transforms the Box (B) to

B 200 200 500 6300;

These co-ordinates are in centimicrons, so in microns we
have a box 2x2um centred at (x,y)=(5,63).

   With a 0.13um techno I have

DS 1 1 4;
L CCC;
B 64 64 110 1386;

The scaling is 1/4 which transforms the Box (B) to

B 16 16 27.5 346.5;

These co-ordinates are in centimicrons, so in microns we
have a box 0.16x0.16um centred at (x,y)=(0.275,3.465).

In the case of the 2um techno, I think the CIF writer has used the
scaling factor as a way to reduce the CIF file size. All
co-ordinates are on an integer multiple and one could use

DS 1 1 1;
B 200 200 500 6300;

In the case of the 0.13um techno, the resolution is 5nm which is
less than 1 centimetre. So a scaling factor must be used to force
all geometry turnpoints in the CIF file to an integer multiple.

In both cases, the CIF writer (these examples come from Magic)
has chosen the scaling factor which gives the smallest set of
integer numbers (should be min file size) compatible with the
turnpoints all being an even multiple.

I think this is because the centre point of a box can be off
grid.

For the 2um techno, the 2x2 contact above goes from
(4,62) to (6,64). If we have a 3x3 contact extending from
(4,62) to (7,65), then this is a box

DS 1 100 2;
L CCC;
B 6 6 11 127;

with centre point at (5.5,63.5). So even if the turnpoints in this
techno are all on a 1um multiple, the centre point of boxes will
be on a 0.5um multiple. This has to remain an integer in the
CIF file.

Same with the 0.13um techno and a 0.165x0.165um contact
extending from (0.195,3.385) to (0.36,3.55). This is a box

DS 1 1 4;
L CCC;
B 66 66 111 1387;

with centre point at (0.2775,3.4675). Again the turnpoints are
on a 5nm (0.005um) multiple, but the box centre points are on
a 2.5nm one.

The CIF writer has to analyse the geometry turnpoints to find
the correct choice of scaling factor.

hope this helps, Graham Petley

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Graham,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry - I allowed myself to change the subject.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> About CIF coordinates - you're right. I can see the difference after 
</I>&gt;<i> importing GDS and CIF. I've missed the coefficient when transferring CIF 
</I>&gt;<i> coordinates to TDT. My problem however is that I can't get to a factor 
</I>&gt;<i> of 500.
</I>&gt;<i> Currently the TDT DB is using the GDSII convention:
</I>&gt;<i> DBU - Size of database units in meters (1e-9 by default)
</I>&gt;<i> UU - Size of user unit in DBU (1e-3 by default)
</I>&gt;<i> Then all coordinates are represented internally in database units as 
</I>&gt;<i> 32-bit integers. UU is used in the user interfaces for convenience. 
</I>&gt;<i> Import/Export to GDSII is trivial in this matter, because it is 
</I>&gt;<i> virtually the same.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> CIF is using also integers to represent the coordinates and they are 
</I>&gt;<i> talking about the precision 1/100 microns (i.e. 1e-8) which is a 
</I>&gt;<i> constant. If I understand this properly my coefficient on CIF import 
</I>&gt;<i> should be 10. Where the other 50 are coming from?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Regards
</I>&gt;<i> Svilen
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> P.S. Because CIF definition is quite fuzzy and there are a lot of 
</I>&gt;<i> interpretations - I did a wiki page. You can find a reference to the 
</I>&gt;<i> paper I was using there
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://toped.wikispaces.com/Toped+CIF+parser">http://toped.wikispaces.com/Toped+CIF+parser</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Svilen,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've just noticed that the gds file exported from the cif2tdt
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; TELL script has its geometries scaled 500X too small. A cell
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which should be 32um wide is actually 0.064um.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The gds2tdt script exports correctly sized gds files.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think this is where the text size discrepancy comes from.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; best regards, Graham Petley
