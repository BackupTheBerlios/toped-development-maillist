<PRE>Hi Graham,

I'll have some questions on this one first. Unfortunately I don't have 
Ubuntu installed and we don't have a distribution for it, but it's 
probably a good time to start doing something about it.
I've started a download over night, so hopefully I'll have a CD tomorow. 
So here are the questions
- graphic card (ATi, nVidia),  driver, X versions etc. ? You can get 
this from &quot;glxinfo&quot; and &quot;xdpyinfo&quot;.

Your toped window certainly doesn't look great :) We need to resolve 
this in order to discuss the other effects. During an interactive 
drawing the screen is redrawn at each mouse move - that's probably the 
reason how you can &quot;see&quot; something, but normally the background should 
be black. If it isn't - toped can't even clear the canvas which 
indicates that there is something wrong with the connection to the 
underlying graphic libraries.

- About the texts if you imported a layout - if I remember well from 
CIF,  texts are comming unusually big. Try to zoom in (mouse scroll 
wheel is the easiest way) and see whether you can see something more 
sensible. I seem to remember having similar effect with your libraries - 
CIF format doesn't have a text size parameter and the default is 
probably unadequate.

Regards
Svilen
