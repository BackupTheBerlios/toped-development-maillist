<PRE>If the improvements are significant as you say, then
release after 3 months.
As a user, what is tough is frequent releases which don't
bring much material advantage, but require testing with
various circuits to make sure nothing is broken.
If I don't think a new release brings enough advantage,
then I won't do the testing and I'll stick with the old one.

best regards, Graham Petley

</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The next Toped release was planned as
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;consolidation&quot; release. Currently 
</I>&gt;<i> however we're late with some of the originally planned
</I>&gt;<i> updates and 
</I>&gt;<i> fixes. By default we're supposed to produce next
</I>&gt;<i> release in 
</I>&gt;<i> February/March and here is the problem.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On one hand we do have already some important updates and
</I>&gt;<i> fixes which 
</I>&gt;<i> will make a difference in a new release package. A release
</I>&gt;<i> process 
</I>&gt;<i> however takes at least a week and this will put us even
</I>&gt;<i> further behind 
</I>&gt;<i> the schedule. On the other hand it seems that we'll
</I>&gt;<i> need another two or 
</I>&gt;<i> three months to cover at least the major tasks planned for
</I>&gt;<i> this release.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would appreciate your opinion
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Regards
</I>&gt;<i> Svilen
</I>

</PRE>
