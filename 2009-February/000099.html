<PRE>I want to read my standard cell library into Toped, write out
a GDS file and create a Toped database.

I have attached my TELL script. Some comments at the bottom
describe the problems. I think some of these come from Toped
not always completing the read of the TELL script, so that
one has to repeatedly try opening Toped and reading the script
until all the cells are read.

Other problems are
- tdtsave and gdsexport not accepted from within the script
- tdtsave only accepted from menu File&gt;Save
- tdtsave not accepted after a gdsexport
- gdsexport not accepted after a tdtsave
- tdtsave causes Toped to use all CPU cycles of both processors

I think these are all inter-related and it isn't clear what is the
cause and effect here.

The CIF files referenced in the TELL script are in the standard cell
download at www.vlsitechnology.org.

At the end, after repeated attempts, I am able to make the Toped
database and export the GDS file. It would be nice to do it in
one simple script.

best regards, Graham Petley
