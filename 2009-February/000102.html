<PRE>Hi Graham,

I found the problem, thanks for your feedback. See further comments in 
the text below.

I will generate a patch for version 0.9.2 which should remove the 
troubles you're describing in this e-mail.  I'll try to do it tomorrow.

Fixing the troubles with the graphics on Ubuntu might take longer - 
simply because none of us has it installed.

Regards
Svilen

</I>I can see the problem here. Toped is a multi thread application. There 
is a thread related bug specific to the CIF conversion which I just 
found thanks to your script example. I fixed it locally and the 
application doesn't lock itself any more. The script is executed until 
the end every time. 
Just as a confirmation - in the bottom right corner Toped has an 
indication of a running(active) thread. If it's red - means that 
something is going on or (as in this case) the threads are mutually locked.

There is no facilities in 0.9.2 to unlock the application - so it is 
virtually dead. Also in that revision Toped will queue the commands even 
if a thread is locked (the main thread is still alive) and it's not easy 
for the user to find out what's going on. This has been addressed and 
some changes are already in place, so the log window will indicate that 
a command can't be executed because there is another process which is 
using the database at the moment.
This of course is not helping in your situation - all I'm trying to say 
is that some of the commands listed below doesn't work because the 
applications was (most likely) already locked and dead because of the bug.
&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Other problems are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - tdtsave and gdsexport not accepted from within the script
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - tdtsave only accepted from menu File&gt;Save
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - tdtsave not accepted after a gdsexport
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - gdsexport not accepted after a tdtsave
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - tdtsave causes Toped to use all CPU cycles of both processors
</I>See my comment above about locking. All menu commands do generate tell 
commands. There is no different execution patterns - whether you type a 
command or click it with the mouse from the menu. The difference with 
the script is only coming form the fact that when a script is executed 
the commands are coming with the speed which is impossible to be 
achieved interactively (that's the whole idea isn't it? :) )  and some 
troubles can be highlighted very quickly.

About tdtsave - you are right - tdtsave() won't work as it is on your 
script. This is an unnecessary extra check (for active cell) in the save 
operations that should be removed. This can be easily avoided if you 
open any of the cells that you've already converted. for example:

opencell(&quot;xor3v1x2&quot;);

will then allow subsequent
tdtsave();
gdsexport(pharosc_gdsmap,&quot;pharosc200.gds&quot;,false);

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think these are all inter-related and it isn't clear what is the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cause and effect here.
</I>I agree - they are related and I think I found the problem - as 
explained above
&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The CIF files referenced in the TELL script are in the standard cell
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> download at www.vlsitechnology.org.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> At the end, after repeated attempts, I am able to make the Toped
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> database and export the GDS file. It would be nice to do it in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one simple script.
</I>I agree. That's the whole idea.

&gt;&gt;<i>
